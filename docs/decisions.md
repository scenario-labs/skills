# Decisions

The history and evidence behind rules in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). AGENTS.md states each rule; this
file records why, so a settled question is reopened only with new evidence.

## Word budget

The body caps (1000-word target, 2500-word hard cap) come from this repo, not from outside:

- Nothing outside this repo caps a body by word count. The spec says the body has "no format
  restrictions", and `skills-ref` validates a 200,000-word body clean.
- The widely repeated "5000 words" is a debugging remedy for a skill already behaving badly, not a
  budget.
- Anthropic states exactly one size rule, "keep SKILL.md body under 500 lines", and its own "Token
  budgets" section only restates it.
- A line count measures nothing stable here: prettier rewraps prose at 100 columns, and the largest
  body runs about 260 lines. The word cap binds well before 500 lines would, so no line cap is
  enforced.
- The one mechanism that bites is Claude Code's post-compaction re-attach. It keeps the first 5000
  tokens of each invoked skill from a 25,000-token pool shared across them. The pool fills from the
  most recently invoked, so older skills are dropped entirely once it overflows.
- At this repo's density, about 7 characters per word or roughly 1.75 tokens per word, 2500 words is
  near 4400 tokens. That sits inside the per-skill ceiling with margin for identifier-dense prose;
  past it, a body trades content for truncation.
- The cap is the guardrail and the target is the craft. The cap binds a handful of skills; what
  protects the shared pool is the mean, which the fan-out notice watches.

## Model ids and discovery

- Of the 64 tool-tagged Scenario-branded models, 61 report Scenario as provider. The three that
  report BFL are the FLUX upscale variants, upscaling being the one lane among them with
  competitors. Hence the provider check before naming an id.
- `search` with `query="image edit"` returned 318 hits with nothing to choose between them. A skill
  that shipped that query had its member picked by reading marketing blurbs. Hence `recommend` for
  capabilities.
- `recommend` quoted 48.2 CU for a run that billed 55. Hence `dry_run` for the exact price.

## Unversioned skill names

A versioned name goes stale the day the next generation ships. It then forces either a breaking
rename or a pile of near-duplicate skills competing for the same trigger. It is the model-id rule
one level up.

## skills.sh groupings

Our groups were confirmed visible on skills.sh on September 22, 2026. The earlier failure is
recorded at [vercel-labs/skills#2136](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills/issues/2136).

## No install-everything command

The README once offered `--skill "*"`. It takes every skill, the expert tools included, and an agent
loads every installed skill's description at startup: a reader who never opens a DCC tool carried 57
expert descriptions at the time. The default command names the core skills instead.

## Skill and plugin versions

- Each SKILL.md carries `metadata.version`, the release it shipped in. The spec has no version
  field, but its own example uses `metadata.version`, as do other public skill repositories. An
  earlier draft put the version in a body HTML comment so Claude Code agents would see it (Claude
  Code strips frontmatter). It was dropped: no other project does it, and updates belong to the
  distribution layer, not to the agent.
- One release-wide version, not one per skill: `npx skills update` and plugin updates refresh
  everything at once, so a per-skill version adds bookkeeping without changing what a user does.
- Plugins release through a `stable` branch, not pinned versions. Every plugin here has
  `source: "./"`, and without a `version` Claude Code versions it by commit, so every merge to
  `main` was an update for all of them. Pinning the entry version to the release was tried and
  failed in a real install: the catalog follows the branch while the cached files stay at the old
  version. A fresh install then labeled unreleased files with the old release, and a skill added to
  a group between releases broke the whole plugin ("Path not found") until the next release. The
  `stable` branch moves catalog and files together, only at releases, and unpinned entries keep a
  marketplace added from `main` consistent too.
- Plugin names carry a fixed three-digit number, assigned once with gaps and stored in
  `scripts/plugin-names.json` (`030-images`). The skills CLI picker sorts groups by plugin name, so
  a number is what keeps it in `skills.sh.json` order, a deliberate path from getting started to the
  expert tools. The earlier `NN.-` prefix was recomputed from position, so every inserted grouping
  renamed install keys: three times between September and October 2026, once for 16 plugins.
- The README recommends per-role plugin sets over installing everything. Every installed skill puts
  its name and description in every session: the 16 core plugins measured about 10,100 tokens, the
  role sets 700 to 4,000.

## No install commands in skills

The sibling-install sentence once carried `npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`. That
resolves the latest `skills` package and the repository's moving `main`. A marketplace scan flagged
skills carrying it as possibly loading code from an untrusted or mutable source (October 2026), and
the scan names no line, so that sentence is a suspect, not a proven cause.

- A pin cannot live in the skill: a skill cannot name the commit it ships in.
- `skill_get` serves the core skills from the connected Scenario MCP, with no local install. It
  returns markdown only and does not serve the expert tools, so the sentence also links the README's
  Install section. A link is not an instruction to run, and that section carries the pinned form.
- The pinned form `npx skills@<version> add scenario-labs/skills#<commit>` works: skills 1.7.4
  clones that commit and records it in `skills-lock.json` (checked in a container, October 2026). It
  lives in the README, where a person runs it.

## Release tags

Releases through 0.37.3 tagged bare `vX.Y.Z`. That is because a `release-type: node` package gets
its component free from the `package.json` name, while `release-type: simple` has none to derive.
Setting `component` plus `include-component-in-tag` by hand produced the `skills-` prefix.

## AGENTS.md size

- Codex reads 32 KiB of `AGENTS.md` by default (`project_doc_max_bytes`) and silently drops the
  rest. `.codex/config.toml` raised it to 64 KiB, but Codex ignores that file in untrusted projects.
- In October 2026 `AGENTS.md` reached 43 KB, so an untrusted Codex session would stop reading inside
  the release notes, before the Codex attribution rules.
- Claude Code also warns about a memory file past 40,000 characters, at the default context size.
- The fix moved situational sections into `docs/` (31.6 KB left), dropped the override, and made
  `pnpm style` fail past 32 KiB.

## Video verification

A one-frame-per-shot spot check read clean at 10.5s on a clip whose artifact appears at 11.0s. Hence
contact sheets that sweep the whole clip.
