# Listing and install commands

How skills.sh, the installer picker, and the install commands work. [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)
"Adding a skill" holds the checklist; this file holds the mechanics.

- `pnpm groupings` proves `skills.sh.json` valid, not that skills.sh has applied it.
  - Per the [customize docs](https://www.skills.sh/docs/customize), the directory reads the file
    only after its telemetry has seen the repository: in practice, after a fresh
    `npx skills add scenario-labs/skills` run with telemetry enabled.
  - Repo pages are cached, so the skill content on
    [the repo page](https://www.skills.sh/scenario-labs/skills) trails `main` by hours.
  - Ungrouped listings appear under "Other skills". `notGrouped` controls their position, not their
    visibility.
- `pnpm manifest` (`scripts/generate-plugin-manifest.mjs`) generates
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` from `skills.sh.json`, the single source of truth. Never edit
  the manifest by hand. `pnpm manifest:check` fails validation and CI when the two drift; the
  pre-commit hook regenerates the manifest.
  - The manifest gives the `npx skills add` picker its group headers. The skills CLI groups the
    picker by the manifest's plugin entries and never reads `skills.sh.json`, which only drives the
    skills.sh repo page.
  - Plugin names carry a two-digit position prefix (`01.-getting-started`, shown as "01. Getting
    Started"), because the picker sorts group names alphabetically. The prefix makes it follow the
    `skills.sh.json` order, so inserting or merging a grouping renumbers the plugin ids on
    regeneration.
  - The manifest also makes the repo a Claude Code plugin marketplace, `scenario-skills`, one plugin
    per grouping. Claude Code namespaces a plugin's skills under the plugin name, so users see
    `/03.-images:scenario-image`. Renaming a plugin changes its install key
    (`<plugin>@scenario-skills`), so existing installs stop matching it.
  - Each plugin entry carries the release version, so Claude Code updates installed plugins at
    releases, not at every commit to `main`
    ([docs/ci-and-releases.md](ci-and-releases.md#releases)).
- Install commands:
  - `npx skills add scenario-labs/skills` opens a picker with nothing preselected, so a reader who
    runs the bare command and hits enter installs nothing. The README says so on the command.
  - The README does not offer `--skill "*"`: it takes every skill, the expert tools included, and an
    agent loads every installed skill's description at startup.
  - The README Install section leads with a default command that writes out every core skill, then
    points to `INSTALL.md`.
  - `INSTALL.md` holds one command per role and one per goal. A role command is a base of `scenario`
    plus the troubleshooting skills, the role's lead skills, and the siblings they name in
    backticks, one level deep (transitively would pull in nearly everything). A goal command is
    `scenario`, the goal's lead skills, and their siblings.
  - Roles are the complete taxonomy; goals are shortcuts for readers who think in outcomes. Both
    stay in `INSTALL.md`, not the README, so every curated command sits in one checked file.
  - `pnpm readme` checks that every install command passes all its names after one `--skill` (the
    CLI collects names up to the next flag) and names only real skills. It checks that the default
    lists exactly the core skills, and that each family README's command lists exactly its family.
  - Until the skills CLI can install a group from the command line
    ([#192](https://github.com/scenario-labs/skills/issues/192)), `pnpm readme` also fails when a
    core skill sits in no `INSTALL.md` role command, or when a role's or goal's "N skills." count
    disagrees with its command.
  - A skills.sh pack URL (`npx skills add https://skills.sh/p/<id>`) is the only install that
    preselects a set. Packs are created manually on skills.sh behind a Vercel sign-in (no CLI or
    API); pack links belong in README.md's Install section.
