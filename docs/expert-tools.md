# Expert tools

Read this before editing anything under `skills/dcc/` or `skills/game-engines/`.
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) says what the tier is; this file lists how the authoring contract differs
for it.

The authoring contract applies with these differences, because the tier drives an application rather
than the MCP server:

- The MCP rules (MCP as the surface, `recommend` discovery, model ids) do not apply. The rest does,
  including the frontmatter, the 2500-word cap, house style, public content only, and the
  sibling-install sentence.
- Descriptions follow the spec's 1024-character cap, not the 500-character target. Bodies run near
  the cap, not the 1000-word target. Both are the author's choice, kept until a live run shows what
  to trim.
- Shipped scripts need no suite of their own under `tests/<name>/`: the behavior suites live in the
  author's build project and run against the application.
  - One suite per family, `tests/scenario-<app>-expert/` (the same file in each), imports every
    script with system Python and checks that each skill name a script uses to find the lead's
    `scripts/` exists. `pnpm skill-files` still parses every Python script.
  - Blender's `tests/scenario-blender-expert/test_live_gate.py` runs the delivery gate in a real
    Blender against planted defects. `.github/workflows/blender.yml` runs it on Linux whenever a
    Blender script changes; the gate has no per-OS branch. Without Blender installed it skips.
  - Godot also runs the application, on every OS: its toolkit branches per OS (locks, the process
    table, copies). `tests/scenario-godot-expert/test_toolkit_live.py` runs against a real Godot on
    Linux, macOS, and Windows in `.github/workflows/godot.yml` whenever a Godot script changes.
    Without Godot installed its live tests skip; its lock and GUI-check tests still run in
    `pnpm test`.
  - Blender's live suites (`tests/scenario-blender-expert/test_live_*.py`) run Blender headless
    against fixtures with known answers. `.github/workflows/blender.yml` installs the release the
    skills were verified on, on Linux, whenever a Blender script or test changes, and fails if a
    live suite skips. Without Blender they skip in `pnpm test`.
  - Unity's `tests/scenario-unity-expert/test_toolkit_offline.py` needs no application: it runs the
    toolkit's lock probe, process-table parsing, and signal handling in `pnpm test`.
    `.github/workflows/unity.yml` runs it on macOS, the OS the toolkit targets, whenever a Unity
    script changes.
  - Roblox has no Studio in CI. `tests/scenario-roblox-expert/` runs AgentKit modules under Lune
    with fake engine services (`lune/`), and builds places with Rojo to read back with Lune
    (`test_live_rojo.py`). `.github/workflows/roblox.yml` installs the Lune and Rojo versions the
    tooling skill pins, whenever a Roblox script or test changes, and fails if those suites skip.
    Without the tools they skip in `pnpm test`.
- A link to a subfolder (`scripts/AgentKit/`, never `scripts/` itself) covers the files under it:
  these skills ship code trees an agent copies into a project whole.
- cspell skips code, fenced and inline, and YouTube video ids. Prose is checked as everywhere else
  (`cspell.json` overrides).
- Each family is one `skills.sh.json` grouping titled "Expert tools: <app>". Every expert grouping
  comes after every core grouping, so the expert tools stay at the bottom of skills.sh and the
  installer picker (`pnpm groupings` enforces the order; plugin numbers keep the picker in it).
- The [application test protocol](application-test.md) grades MCP plans. For an expert tool, grade
  the plan against the lead skill's execution channels and the application's own documentation
  instead.
