# Godot Expert Skills

Agent skills that let Claude (Claude Code) or Codex drive Godot 4.7 the way the experts in the best tutorials, conference talks and official documentation do. Built on 2026-10-02 with the same method as [Unity Expert Skills](../unity/README.md) and [Blender Expert Skills](../../dcc/blender/README.md): transcripts of top-rated videos, cited expert notes, then skills with tools and review rubrics, graded blind against the same model without them. Every procedure was also run live in Godot 4.7.2. Start with the lead skill, `scenario-godot-expert`.

## Status

- 14 skills (the lead `scenario-godot-expert`, which carries the shared Python toolkit `gd_*` and the GDScript AgentKit, plus 13 specialists) written from 216 expert videos (about 80 h, mostly 2024 to 2026, Godot 4) and 74 documentation pages, each with references, a `gd_<domain>.py` module and GDScript kit code.
- Verified live: every procedure was run in Godot 4.7.2.stable on macOS (Apple Silicon): `godot --headless` jobs, `--import`, windowed captures that were looked at, GUT and gdUnit4 runs, real ENet clients and servers, macOS, Web (loaded in headless Chrome), Android APK and iOS Xcode-project exports. Per-skill counts as reported by each skill's own suite (the units differ, groups or checks, so they are not summed):

- Blind-graded written scenarios (round 1, 12 production briefs): 79 % without the skills (143/180), 92 % with them (165/180). Ten of twelve scenarios improved, one tied (mobile) and one got worse (3D world, 13 vs 14). One grader per scenario and one answer per condition, so read it as a direction, not a statistic. The baseline agents were allowed to probe the installed Godot 4.7.2, which is why the gap is smaller than for the Unity and Unreal Engine skills. The grades measure written plans, not finished games, and were taken before a refactor round that fed every gap back into the skills; the refactored skills were not re-graded. One grader claim (OmniLight3D shadow mode) was found wrong by a live check.
- Not run: installs on phones, store uploads, Apple signing and notarization, Gradle AAB and bundletool, `xcodebuild` (Xcode lacked the iOS platform component), a .NET (C#) Godot build, Steam, Nakama, Colyseus, netfox and WebRTC P2P, the GUI-only editor steps (including MCP servers that open an editor window), godot-cpp and Rust builds, GitHub Actions on a runner, and real Scenario generation (synthetic assets stood in). Each skill lists what it could not run.

## Requirements

- Godot 4.7.2 standard build (tested on 4.7.2.stable; `brew install --cask godot`). No sign-in or license. Export templates for exports (`gd_env.install_templates()` downloads them, about 1.3 GB). Tested on macOS (Apple Silicon) only.
- Python 3.9+ (system `python3`) for the runner-side toolkit; the core uses the standard library. Optional: Pillow and numpy (image checks), Playwright with an installed Chrome (Web browser checks), an Android SDK and JDK and Xcode (mobile exports), ffmpeg (audio analysis).
- GUT and gdUnit4 are downloaded on demand by the toolkit.

The lead skill `scenario-godot-expert` explains the execution channels: `godot --headless` jobs, windowed capture runs, an editor MCP server, and GUT or gdUnit4 tests.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill scenario-godot-expert --skill scenario-godot-2d --skill scenario-godot-3d-world --skill scenario-godot-animation --skill scenario-godot-architecture --skill scenario-godot-audio --skill scenario-godot-gameplay --skill scenario-godot-multiplayer --skill scenario-godot-performance-export --skill scenario-godot-pipeline-automation --skill scenario-godot-rendering-lighting --skill scenario-godot-shaders --skill scenario-godot-ui --skill scenario-godot-vfx
```

The installer puts the skills side by side, which the specialists need: they import the lead skill's `scripts/` (Python toolkit and GDScript AgentKit). In the installer picker (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills`), the family is the "Expert tools: Godot" group. Update with `npx skills update`.

## Provenance

Ported from [edemaistre/godot-expert-skills](https://github.com/edemaistre/godot-expert-skills/tree/v0.1), built on 2026-10-02, with these changes: the `scenario-` prefix on every skill name, this repository's frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `license`), no version line in the skill bodies, the sibling-install line in each `SKILL.md`, file paths in each `SKILL.md` turned into links, and US spelling in the prose. To fit the 2500-word cap, the lead skill's toolkit signature block was replaced by a link to the same API in `references/procedures.md` section 1, and its Godot 4.7 traps and macOS notes moved unchanged to `references/traps.md`.

Inside references, code comments and revision notes, "v0.1" and "0.1" name the internal build round; Python scripts still expose `__version__ = "0.1"`, an internal marker, not this repository's release.

Paths such as `tests/code/...`, `tests/projects/...` or `tests/live_evidence/...` inside the skills point to the build project (tests, live evidence) on the author's machine; they are provenance only and are not part of this repo.
