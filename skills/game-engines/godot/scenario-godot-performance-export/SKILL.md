# Godot performance and release

Target: Godot 4.7.2.stable, macOS Apple Silicon.

Expert level here means every claim about speed comes with a before and after number from the same harness, every build is verified as a file before anyone calls it shipped, and the agent knows which numbers Godot reports wrongly. The stance: measure, classify the bound, fix the biggest cost, re-measure, compare pictures, then ship builds you have opened, run and listed. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-godot-expert (channels, the review loop, toolkit, 4.7 traps).

## Stance (the expert delta)

1. **Classify before fixing.** Frame time is the slower of CPU and GPU, so a fix on the other side gains nothing (general optimization doc). Live: cutting draw calls from 2,501 to 2 dropped CPU from 2.7 to 0.35 ms and left the GPU at 6.2 ms; only the shadow budget moved the GPU (to 1.7 ms). Run a half-resolution pass: when GPU time does not fall, resolution is not the problem [added]. First log `RenderingServer.get_video_adapter_name()`: a hybrid laptop may run on its integrated GPU; `--gpu-index N` picks another [added].
2. **Nodes cost before pixels do.** Per-node `_process`, thousands of nodes and redundant physics objects are the usual Godot CPU cost (Firebelley 1PnG3r1rKcs: 115 ms to about 8 ms with RenderingServer items; DwMoEdAhtYQ, O5a4AKemkiQ). Replace repeats with MultiMesh and a shader, and centralize ticking. Live: 2,000 MeshInstance3D created in 2.3 ms, 0.6 ms through `RenderingServer.instance_create2`.
3. **Spread periodic work.** Random phase per poller, `force_raycast_update()` on a disabled RayCast (Dan Does Dev, s2C2RO_WMh0 [00:05:34]). Live: 600 agents, worst tick 1.93 to 0.64 ms, spike frames 62 to 16.
4. **Hand-sized occluders, judged by objects drawn.** Box occluders per big wall beat a whole-scene bake (Zenva, VBiBZBVxu1s: about 300 to 80 FPS baked versus 350 with boxes). Occlusion is a CPU raster: judge by objects drawn from several camera spots.
5. **Hitches are loading, pipelines and runtime bakes.** Load AND instantiate off the main thread, ship a warm pipeline cache (Shader Baker export option, 4.5), and log the `PIPELINE_COMPILATIONS_*` deltas per frame so each hitch is classed as load or compile. Navmesh bakes and ReflectionProbes on Always at area boundaries are the other suspects [added]. Live worst frame: synchronous 453 ms cold, threaded load plus instantiate 230 ms cold, 9.6 ms warm.
6. **Test on the real target, long enough.** Export With Debug does not slow the game; throttling shows only on long runs (Ian Bolton, Arm, WrjaUNAXYqk [00:05:20, 00:09:35]). Soak a phone 30 minutes in the heaviest area and gate on minutes 20 to 30 [added duration]. Clean build for every perf report: a stale cache hid a perf bug for weeks (Claire Blackshaw, grdqHJOL5F4 [00:16:15]).
7. **Exports fail on environment and credentials, not on Godot.** Templates per exact version, JDK and SDK paths, ETC2/ASTC import, bundle ids, signing identities, server headers. Credentials go in `GODOT_*` env vars, never in `export_presets.cfg` (export docs; Nihamkin _n9l15CANag [00:25:38]).
8. **Web is Compatibility only and single-threaded by default.** Threads need COOP `same-origin` plus COEP `require-corp` over HTTPS (web doc). Live: the threaded build without headers does not start.
9. **A written plan must run without this toolkit.** Next to every `gd_perf` call, give the engine code or CLI it wraps: the logger below, `godot --headless --export-release`, the env vars, `bundletool`, `xcodebuild`. Round-1 blind grading docked plans a reader could not run.

## Establish first

| Input                            | Why it changes the plan                                               | Default if unknown                                       |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Target hardware and frame budget | 16.67 ms at 60 fps, 33.33 at 30, 11.11 at 90 (VR), 8.33 at 120        | 60 fps on the lowest named device                        |
| Renderer per platform            | auto-instancing, occlusion, features differ; web forces Compatibility | Forward+ desktop, Mobile on phones, Compatibility on web |
| Where it is slow                 | steady low fps versus hitches when loading or turning                 | profile both                                             |
| Platforms and stores             | signing, ids, size limits, AAB versus APK                             | ask; each store needs account steps                      |
| Download budget                  | wasm, pck, APK sizes                                                  | the bytes the host really serves                         |
| Who holds credentials            | keystores, Apple team, Steam builder                                  | the agent never invents or stores secrets                |

## Workflow

1. **Baseline on a clean project copy.** Clone with `gd_env.base_project`, `gd_perf.install(P)`, rename `application/config/name` (Base3D clones otherwise share one `user://` and shader cache). Read `project.godot` back: Jolt for 3D, the renderer you mean. `gd_perf.scene_audit` on the heavy scene. GATE: audit JSON saved, physics engine and renderer confirmed.
2. **Measure windowed, per variable.** `gd_perf.profile_variant(P, scene, size=(1280, 720), driver="vulkan")`: per-frame CSV, visible and shadow draw calls, scene `_process` time from sentinel nodes. Never use `Performance.TIME_PROCESS` per frame: it holds one value for about a second. Metal reports GPU 0 on macOS; use Vulkan. Windowed frame time is capped at the refresh; judge gpu_ms and cpu_ms. Deeper: `--gpu-profile`, the Visual Profiler, the script Profiler (read Self, not Inclusive; it does not cover C#), RenderDoc or the vendor tool for one frame. GATE: two runs within 10 % [added].
3. **Classify.** `gd_perf.classify(full, half_res)`. GATE: a written verdict (CPU scripts, CPU render, GPU fill, GPU geometry or shadows) backed by numbers.
4. **Fix one thing, re-measure, look.** `gd_perf.apply_fix(P, scene, out, fix)` writes a new scene: `share_materials`, `multimesh`, `shadow_budget`, `box_occluders`, `visibility_range`, `strip_process` (lab only: drops `_process` scripts once a shader does their work). `gd_perf.compare(before, after)` applies a 5 % and 0.1 ms noise floor. Capture before and after, contact sheet, open it. Resolution scale below an agreed floor (0.67) needs sign-off [added]. GATE: metric improved beyond noise, nothing regressed, mean luma difference under 0.02 or the change approved.
5. **Hitch pass.** `perf_bench.gd:hitch` with a fresh private HOME for a cold shader cache. GATE: worst frame under 2x the budget on warm cache, pipeline compilations off gameplay frames.
6. **Ship builds.** Presets through `gd_run.ensure_preset` plus `gd_perf.preset_fields`; exports under `gd_perf.export_env(HOME=private_home)`. Plain CLI: `godot --headless --path . --export-release "<preset>" <out>`. Verify each artifact: `verify_macos`, `verify_apk`, `verify_xcode_project`, `pck_listing`, `size_report`, `web_smoke`. GATE: per platform below.
7. **Run what you exported.** `gd_perf.run_exported(exe, ["--headless", "--", "--perf-log", "--perf-quit"])` with [`perf_logger.gd`](scripts/agentkit/perf/perf_logger.gd); web through headless Chrome. GATE: `SHIP_BOOT` shows the expected tags and renderer, `PERF_SUMMARY` p95 within budget, no errors.
8. **Release audit and handover.** `gd_perf.release_audit(P)`; write signing, notarization and upload steps for the human holding the accounts (`notarize_plan`, `steam_vdf`). GATE: no high flag; account steps listed as "not run" with the reason.

**Phones.** Mobile renderer, or Compatibility for the widest low-end reach (Ray Hayes, KWhVVMpihsc [00:06:03]); `fallback_to_opengl3` is on by default and changes the look, so capture the fallback too [00:05:12]. Low tier: `scaling_3d_scale` 0.67 to 0.8, `Engine.max_fps = 30`, physics tick 30 with interpolation on (O5a4AKemkiQ [00:03:43]). Apply the safe area on Android too: 4.7.2 APKs target SDK 36 (measured), so Android 15+ draws edge to edge [added]. Android build: `--install-android-build-template` only together with an export command (with `--quit` it installs nothing, measured), keystore in `GODOT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_RELEASE_{PATH,USER,PASSWORD}`, size with `bundletool build-apks --connected-device` then `get-size total` [not run]. Thermal soak: log `adb shell dumpsys thermalservice` every 10 s; Streamline region markers and Performance Advisor in CI (WrjaUNAXYqk [00:14:43]); `Performance.add_custom_monitor` for on-device game metrics. Wire a crash reporter and test the next OS beta before launch (8zqjiRuhQLE [00:03:40, 00:09:11]). iOS: export writes an Xcode project, then `xcodebuild archive` and `-exportArchive`; create the App Store Connect record before the first upload, raise the build number each time, no simulator for Vulkan renderers, `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` when export says "xcodebuild requires Xcode" (x_ZFAV2id3I [00:14:41, 00:17:04, 00:40:34]). IAP: store plugins and accounts, never faked.

**Web.** Single-threaded unless threads were measured to matter. itch.io serves files as uploaded (no on-the-fly compression), so budget the bytes it sends. Background tabs pause `_process` and drop networked games; HTTPRequest has no chunked responses and one progress step per frame; a stale service worker can show another project (web doc). Once isolated, cross-origin fetches need CORS or CORP [added]. C# projects cannot export to web (version deltas 16). Leaderboard read-only in the browser.

## Engine-only frame logger (no toolkit, run 2026-10-02)

```gdscript
extends Node   # autoload "Bench"; run the game with: -- --bench
var ai_ms := 0.0
var _vp: RID
var _rows := PackedStringArray(["frame_ms,render_cpu_ms,gpu_ms,draw_calls,pipelines_total"])
func _ready() -> void:
	if not "--bench" in OS.get_cmdline_user_args():
		set_process(false)
		return
	_vp = get_viewport().get_viewport_rid()
	RenderingServer.viewport_set_measure_render_time(_vp, true)
	Performance.add_custom_monitor("game/ai_ms", _get_ai_ms)   # a method, never a lambda
	print("BENCH adapter=", RenderingServer.get_video_adapter_name())
func _get_ai_ms() -> float:
	return ai_ms
func _process(delta: float) -> void:
	var pipes := Performance.get_monitor(Performance.PIPELINE_COMPILATIONS_SURFACE) \
		+ Performance.get_monitor(Performance.PIPELINE_COMPILATIONS_SPECIALIZATION)
	_rows.append("%.2f,%.3f,%.3f,%d,%d" % [delta * 1000.0,
		RenderingServer.viewport_get_measured_render_time_cpu(_vp),
		RenderingServer.viewport_get_measured_render_time_gpu(_vp),
		Performance.get_monitor(Performance.RENDER_TOTAL_DRAW_CALLS_IN_FRAME), pipes])
func _exit_tree() -> void:
	if is_processing():
		Performance.remove_custom_monitor("game/ai_ms")
		FileAccess.open("user://bench.csv", FileAccess.WRITE).store_string("\n".join(_rows))
```

Pipeline counters are cumulative: a hitch row whose total rose is a compile. GPU time reads 0 for the first frames.

## Quality gates

- **Measured:** p95 frame or GPU time within budget on the target class; worst frame on area load; `compare` shows the intended metric moved and none regressed; `scene_audit` has no high flag.
- **Visual:** before and after contact sheet (1600 px max) opened; occluder debug capture; web canvas screenshot.
- **macOS:** `codesign --verify --deep --strict` OK, Debugging entitlement off, both archs; Gatekeeper accepts only after notarization.
- **Android:** `apksigner` verifies, signer SHA-256 equals the keystore, versionCode raised, release not debuggable, planned ABIs, no password in presets.
- **iOS:** Xcode project with scheme, bundle id and team; unsigned `xcodebuild` passes once the iOS platform is installed.
- **Web:** boots in headless Chrome as served; `crossOriginIsolated` true if threaded; no page errors; served size within budget.
- **Packs:** base pck holds no excluded content; DLC loads with `replace_files=false`; demo tag only in the demo.

## Handoffs

scenario-godot-rendering-lighting (shadow budgets, bake modes, quality tiers), scenario-godot-shaders (MultiMesh vertex animation, Shader Baker), scenario-godot-3d-world (LOD, visibility ranges, occluders, Jolt, Large World Coordinates or origin shifting for big maps), scenario-godot-gameplay and scenario-godot-architecture (managers, pooling, staggered timers, threaded loading), scenario-godot-ui (touch layout, safe areas), scenario-godot-multiplayer (web transport, dedicated server, trusted leaderboard writes), scenario-godot-pipeline-automation (CI exports, clean builds), scenario-godot-audio (Sample playback on web). Humans: Apple Developer ID, App Store Connect, Play Console, Steamworks, consoles, IAP products. Audit flags carry the owner ([`perf_audit.gd`](scripts/agentkit/perf/perf_audit.gd)).

## Godot 4.7 notes

- `OS.get_thermal_state` does not exist in 4.7.2: log frame times over the soak, and OS thermal status from adb or Instruments.
- Defaults checked: `rendering_method.mobile="mobile"`, `rendering_method.web="gl_compatibility"`, occlusion culling off, `import_etc2_astc` false in a hand-written project, physics interpolation off, physics 60 Hz, `fallback_to_opengl3` true, `OmniLight3D.omni_shadow_mode` Cube, `light_bake_mode` Dynamic, web audio Sample.
- Pck format 4 (`pck_listing` reads it). Jolt is default for new 3D projects since 4.6; a hand-written `project.godot` needs the setting.
- Android: JDK 17; Godot seeds JDK and SDK paths from JAVA_HOME and ANDROID_HOME only when it creates its editor settings; permissions are not auto-requested since 4.3.
- iOS export needs `application/export_project_only` without a signing team; `gd_run.export` reports failure because no `.ipa` exists.
- Physics interpolation (2D 4.3, 3D 4.4) makes a lower physics tick viable.
