# scenario-godot-ui: critique rubric

Score each line pass or fail, with the evidence (a number from the AGENT_RESULT or what you saw in a sheet). Do not deliver a UI with a failed blocker.

## Blockers (measured)

| Check                           | Pass condition                                                                                              | Tool                                     |

## Visual review (open the contact sheet)

- Selection is the highest-contrast element; still obvious in grayscale (Rawb Herb).
- The focus ring is visible on every control type (Button, OptionButton, slider, tabs).
- Nothing important sits under the red notch bands; backgrounds do extend under them.
- Black bars only where the stretch aspect says so; nothing stretched or blurry at 4K.
- CJK and Arabic glyphs are complete (no tofu boxes); Arabic layout is mirrored; numbers stay readable.
- Pseudolocalized brackets are visible at both ends of each string (nothing clipped).
- Two or three fonts at most; body text readable at phone size.
- HUD frames, bars and minimap keep their aspect; the trail bar reads as damage.

## Judgment calls

- `canvas_items` vs `viewport`: crisp UI and high-res art vs pixel art (docs, Gwizz).
- `expand` vs `keep_width`: multi-ratio game vs a HUD-first portrait game where the height can grow (docs).
- Square base vs 16:9 base: phone portrait and landscape in scope or not (docs, measured).
- CSV vs PO: agent and small team vs translators with gettext tools (jitspoe, Cashew OldDew).
- `offset_transform` vs wrapper minimum size: decoration vs motion the layout must follow (MrElipteach).

## Red flags in a proposal

- "Headless root is 64x64, so test in SubViewports." This is wrong in 4.7.2: `root.size` works headless.
- A base swap at runtime for portrait, when one square base covers both orientations.
- HUD values updated in `_process`.
- `theme_override_*` across many scenes instead of a Theme.
- Captures through an embedded Window with `content_scale_*` (draws unscaled).
- Touch sizes given in logical pixels without the scale.
- A round minimap mask with children on another `z_index` (they escape `clip_children`).
- `set_anchors_preset()` alone on a Control that was moved (old offsets kept).
- Default Theme Scale changed at runtime (read once).
