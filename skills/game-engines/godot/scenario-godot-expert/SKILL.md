# Godot expert (technical director and agent protocol)

Target: Godot 4.7.2.stable (standard build, no C#), macOS Apple Silicon, Metal by default.

Expert Godot work is a loop run against evidence: set the budget, build one stage, measure it, look at it, fix it, advance. An agent without a mouse gets there by picking the right channel, passing only on a machine-readable result, and never trusting one signal alone. This skill is that protocol, the shared toolkit every scenario-godot-* skill calls ([`scripts/`](scripts/)), and the map of the team. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

**Status (2026-10-02):** every toolkit function below ran in Godot 4.7.2 here (23 live tests, 17 offline, all pass; [`references/procedures.md`](references/procedures.md)). The pre-release triage of the 13 domain skills' findings is in `tests/OPEN_ISSUES.md` (Lead triage).

## Stance (the expert delta)

1. **Headless output is the truth; the editor's Output panel is not.** MCP servers that scrape it "report errors for lines no longer on disk", and it does not list every project error (Fennara, 2vSYP7GyA5U [00:02:51, 00:06:20]). PixelLab's agent runs the Godot binary itself and reads the console (THwZYWuOdZI [00:13:45]). Pass on the `AGENT_RESULT` envelope plus a log scan, never on "it exited": a script with a parse error exits 0, with or without `--check-only`, and so does a script path Godot cannot find (version deltas, verified; L6).
2. **One writer per project.** A GUI editor holding a project keeps its own copy of the open scenes, so its next save can overwrite a headless edit [added]; merged `.tscn` files can fail to parse (Lilith Duncan, CAJ_iIedx_I [00:01:36]). The toolkit refuses a project a GUI Godot has open; work through that editor (MCP) or ask the user to close it. Never close a Godot or Blender process you did not start [added].
3. **Milliseconds against a budget, on the target.** Measure before optimizing (Dan Does Dev, s2C2RO_WMh0 [00:07:12]); profile on the real device class, thermals included (Ian Bolton, WrjaUNAXYqk [00:09:35]). Headless frame time is loop time, not game cost; windowed frame time on this Mac is pinned to the display refresh; judge `gpu_ms` and `cpu_ms` (observed).
4. **Look AND check.** Every frame goes through [`gd_review.image_checks`](scripts/gd_review.py) and a contact sheet you open. Headless draws nothing, so captures need a windowed run (observed). After AI asset import, check facing, animation direction, tile seams and camera jitter by eye (PixelLab, THwZYWuOdZI).
5. **Tests are the contract.** Assert on signals and public results, not internals (Godotneers, CreugthdgJ0 [01:08:36]; Butch Wesley, ImqhHLlPfZg [00:16:59]; Mike Schulze, x6GdTgIAFiU [00:24:19]); bound every await (2 s Godotneers, 5 s Schulze); prove the test bites by emptying the function and watching it go red (Wesley [00:13:40]).
6. **Design for a mouseless driver.** Split body and brain so a test brain can steer a character (Godotneers [00:18:14]). Headless has no mouse device (Wesley [00:48:33]), yet GUI input still tests headless: `get_viewport().push_input(event, true)` reaches Controls, while `Input.parse_input_event` never reaches a MOUSE_FILTER_STOP Control (scenario-godot-gameplay, scenario-godot-ui, observed); pass `true` so positions are logical, not window pixels. Levels hold a spawn point, not the player (Godotneers [00:56:56]).
7. **Edits persist only with `owner` and a save.** `add_child` alone is invisible in the Scene dock and lost on save (Godot docs, Running code in the editor); script edits bypass Undo unless routed through `EditorUndoRedoManager` (Queble, nW7YtSSJzbQ [00:04:41]).
8. **Be honest about visual editors.** VisualShader, AnimationTree, the TileSet and theme editors, and the particle inspector are visual; the agent writes `.gdshader`, `.tres`/`.tscn` text, or builds the resource in code, and names the GUI path for a human. Pick an MCP by feedback fidelity, not tool count (Fennara [00:09:22]).

## Execution channels

| Channel                                                               | Use for                                                       | Cost (measured here)                           | Rules                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Headless job** [`gd_run.run_script`](scripts/gd_run.py)             | logic, data, audits, scene building, imports, tests, exports  | 0.2 s for a small job; `--import` about 2 s    | default channel; watchdog ends a hung job (exit 124)                                                                      |
| **Windowed job** `capture_scene`, `capture_sequence`, `profile_scene` | anything that must render: screenshots, sequences, GPU time   | about 1 s for 4 views                          | 160x90 window, SubViewport at the requested size, focus handed back (2 restores per run observed); `GD_MAX_WINDOWED` 2    |
| **Headless editor** `run_script(editor=True)`                         | EditorInterface: open, edit and save scenes; EditorFileSystem | 1.1 s                                          | wait 2 frames before editor calls; without `-e` EditorInterface calls fail (observed)                                     |
| **GUI editor + MCP** (hybridindie `godot-editor-mcp`)                 | the user's open editor: live tree, selection, undoable edits  | stdio probe 0.9 s, 23 tools exposed by default | only when the user has the editor open; project-local `.mcp.json` only ([`gd_live.write_mcp_config`](scripts/gd_live.py)) |
| **Running game + MCP** (tugcantopaloglu)                              | drive a running game (input, eval)                            | not run here                                   | clone, `npm run build`, a game autoload on port 9090                                                                      |

`gd_live.channels(P)` reports what is possible now. Prefer the headless channels; add an MCP for live scene inspection.

## Establish first

Ask once, then run: target platforms and lowest device; frame budget (default 60 fps desktop, 30 fps mobile); 2D or 3D; renderer (Forward+ desktop 3D, Mobile for demanding phones, Compatibility for web and widest reach, after Ray Hayes, KWhVVMpihsc [00:06:03]); art style and pixel art or not; whether the user's editor has the project open; the deliverable. Then `gd_live.channels(P)` and `gd_run.audit(P, "project")`, and write the renderer, physics engine (Jolt for 3D), stretch mode, main scene and autoloads into the plan.

## Workflow (the expert loop)

1. **Brief in numbers.** Budgets per platform, resolution, scale, style. GATE: every later check has a number to compare with.
2. **Project.** `gd_env.base_project("3d"|"2d", dest)` (APFS clone, 0.01 s, its own `user://` folder) or `new_project(...)`, which writes the project-manager defaults a hand-written `project.godot` lacks. GATE: `audit(P, "project")` has no flags.
3. **Baseline.** `check_all(P)`, `audit(P, "scene", scene=...)`, captures from fixed views, a profile if performance matters. GATE: zero parse and script errors; flags fixed or listed; sheet opened.
4. **Build one stage** with small idempotent jobs (get-or-create, `owner` set, explicit save). Route domain work to its owner (below).
5. **Measure.** Audit, tests (`run_tests`), `profile_scene` plus [`gd_stat.budget_check`](scripts/gd_stat.py), or the export result. GATE: numbers against the brief.
6. **Look AND check.** Same views, `image_checks`, contact sheet opened, judged with the domain skill's critique. GATE: no flag that sets `ok` false, the change visible (`compare` changed_fraction above 0).
7. **Fix before advancing**, one change at a time; `compare` proves parity or gain.
8. **Deliver with evidence.** Each step with its toolkit call, then **Verified** (what ran, result file, number or frame) and **Assumed** (not run, defaults). Never call a scene, shader, level or build done without numbers and a frame you looked at.

## Shared toolkit ([`scripts/`](scripts/), the contract for every scenario-godot-* skill)

`import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "<scenario-godot-expert>/scripts")`. System python3, standard library (Pillow optional).

Every `gd_env`, `gd_run`, `gd_review`, `gd_stat` and `gd_live` call, with defaults and return values: [`references/procedures.md`](references/procedures.md) section 1. Most used: `gd_env.new_project`, `gd_run.run_script`, `gd_run.capture_scene`, `gd_run.profile_scene`, `gd_run.export`, `gd_review.image_checks`.

Every `gd_run` run returns `ok`, `error`, `result` (the job's dictionary), `exit_code`, `timed_out`, `parse_errors`, `script_errors`, `shader_errors`, `engine_errors`, `warnings`, `leaks`, `log_path`, `result_path`. Output lands in `<project>/.agent_out/` (carries `.gdignore`). Concurrency: `GD_MAX` (6) Godot processes, `GD_MAX_WINDOWED` (2), one per project, all through `gd_run.godot_slot`; `GodotBusy` when a GUI editor holds the project.

A domain job is a GDScript file in the project (AgentKit, [`scripts/agentkit/`](scripts/agentkit/), is copied to `res://addons/agentkit/`):

```gdscript
extends "res://addons/agentkit/agent_job.gd"
func run() -> Dictionary:
	var scene := await load_scene("res://main.tscn", 2)   # in the tree, 2 frames waited
	note("children", scene.get_child_count())
	return {"ok": true, "speed": arg("speed", 4.0)}       # arg() typed by its default
```

Or a method on any RefCounted script, `run_script(P, "res://tools/x.gd:build", args)` (it receives the job). Errors logged during the job flip `ok` to false unless `expect_errors` is set. A script error aborts a typed `run() -> Dictionary`, which then returns `{}`: an empty result always fails (`aborted: true`), even with `expect_errors`, so return at least `{"ok": true}`. `export` reports `bytes` for every file it wrote (`main_bytes` for the named one) and treats an iOS `export_project_only` Xcode project as the `artifact`. Captures emulate the project stretch (keep, keep_width, keep_height, expand, ignore, integer scale, scale factor, viewport mode) with black bars, matching the engine on 15 cases (L20); in your own job read a `make_viewport` SubViewport with `agent_capture.grab(vp)`. Helpers: `arg`, `out_path`, `load_scene`, `wait_frames`, `wait_physics_frames`, `wait_seconds`, `note`, `is_headless`, `captured_errors`; libraries [`agent_build.gd`](scripts/agentkit/agent_build.gd) (`save_scene`, presets), [`agent_profile.gd`](scripts/agentkit/agent_profile.gd) (`record`). Domain code goes in `scripts/gd_<domain>.py` and `scripts/agentkit/<domain>/`.

## Quality gates

- **Measurable:** `ok` true with zero parse, script and shader errors; `check_all` `failed_files == []`; JUnit `failures == 0` and `tests > 0`; audit flags fixed or justified; `budget_check` ok (p95 under target, hitch ratio at most 1%); export exit 0, artifact size recorded, `verify_pack` lists the expected files.
- **Visual:** every capture passes `image_checks` (`ok` false on all_black, all_white, uniform, transparent) and was opened in a contact sheet; before and after from the same views.

A cross-cutting item has one owner: shader stutter and web threading go to scenario-godot-performance-export, naming the second skill in the brief. Every handoff packet carries: project path and channel, the brief in numbers, what was done with its toolkit calls, evidence (result JSON path, contact sheet and flags, CSV with `budget_check`, JUnit totals, export sizes), Verified, Assumed, open issues, and a fence (what the receiver may touch). The receiver reproduces one piece of evidence before building on it. Sister teams: blender-expert (asset fixes before GLB export), unreal-expert, unity-expert, maya-expert, zbrush-expert.

## Scenario assets into Godot

| Asset                                      | Generated with                                      | Lands in                                                          |

Check the asset before import (scenario-quality-gate) and again after it, in a capture from the game camera judged by the receiving skill, which also audits GLB scale, pivot and triangle count.

## Godot 4.7 traps and macOS notes

Read [`references/traps.md`](references/traps.md) before the first job: Godot 3 names that pass `--check-only`, `--script` hangs, unknown flags ignored, `-d` waiting on stdin, what headless cannot do (MultiMesh writes, GPUParticles), `ProjectSettings.save()` rewriting `project.godot`, import crashes, deprecated APIs; then the macOS binary, template and `user://` paths, window focus, and Metal profiling.
