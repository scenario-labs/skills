# Unreal animation (technical animator)

Expert level means contact that holds on every clip the game plays, locomotion authored against the
movement model that changes category on the input frame, animation that costs a measured number of
milliseconds on the target, and clean data at the source. The agent works through data and
templates: it scripts assets, IK Rigs, retargeters, databases and settings, duplicates Epic's
AnimBPs instead of drawing graphs, measures contact numerically, then looks at frames. If a sibling
skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it
(`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and
flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-unreal-expert (channels, review loop, 5.8 traps).

**Status (2026-10-21):** what ran in Unreal and what did not:
[`references/sources.md`](references/sources.md).

Import:
`sys.path[:0] = ["<skills>/scenario-unreal-animation/scripts", "<skills>/scenario-unreal-expert/scripts"]; import ue_anim as A`.

## Stance (the expert delta)

- **Cheapest transfer first, then retarget order decides contact.** Same skeleton, compatible
  skeletons, Copy Pose From Mesh or Leader Pose beat an IK Retargeter (Greg Richardson, -8CQNaODNNA
  [00:02:40]-[00:06:04]). When retargeting: a new named retarget pose (never Default) with auto
  align, snap to ground, slight knee and elbow bend; Scale Source once at the top, judged by the IK
  goals; Blend to Source on leg IK or feet sink; auto-exported retargeters have IK off (Richardson
  [00:08:13], [00:16:29], [00:21:26], [00:29:14]). Pin the IK helper bones gameplay reads
  (`ik_foot_l/r`, `ik_hand_gun`); one-off fixes go in an Additive Pose op, not the base pose
  (Richardson [00:33:16]; 5.8 retargeting doc).
- **Movement model first, then animate against it.** Tune capsule speeds, acceleration and braking
  with rough animation until it plays well, export the capsule trajectory, animate the root
  frame-exact with the chest (not the hips) within tolerance and 5-frame stops where the body
  overshoots. This separates animation bugs from system bugs (GASP team, Tony, mhVp_cC9MLc
  [00:24:25]-[00:28:43]; Dustin DeVoe, FLDXtAV7qsw [00:06:27]-[00:08:40]).
- **Motion matching is data under designer control.** Split databases by movement state, pick them
  with a Chooser on cached enums, interrupt only when a core state changed this frame, keep root
  motion enabled on every locomotion clip even when the capsule drives (GASP team
  [00:29:43]-[00:40:54], [01:30:00]). Weights encode a preference between imperfect candidates with
  low coverage (Sam [00:49:01]); they never fix a speed or coverage mismatch, and late tuning uses
  notify-state tags, not schema weights (Jose, tNw9lD2PW3U [00:18:28]; motion matching doc).
- **Small sets ship with procedural nodes.** 13 clips give a non-strafing base, 26 with strafing, 60
  to 80 with states, both feet for every start, stop and refacing start (DeVoe
  [00:11:14]-[00:14:44]); "a misnomer that you need all coverage" (GASP [01:21:06]). Sparse data
  needs Steering before Offset Root Bone, foot placement and mesh-space additives, not a state
  machine (DeVoe [00:28:19]-[00:31:40]).
- **Keep the AnimBP off the game thread, and budget root motion.** Thread-safe update, Property
  Access, fast path on every node (Matthew Lake, N_suMyUuork [00:12:44]-[00:16:53]). Root Motion
  from Everything AND from Montages Only both update the AnimGraph on the game thread (root motion
  doc; Lake [00:13:18]). Montages Only is chosen because capsule-driven locomotion networks well,
  not to save threads: budget its cost; a character with no root-motion montage can use No Root
  Motion Extraction [inference from the doc wording, verify in Insights].
- **Clean at the source, throttle what is unseen.** Stripping twist, face and deformation tracks and
  Maya helper curves cut storage 71% and memory 90% on one clip; import defaults set project-wide,
  not per asset (Lake [00:05:15]-[00:07:21]). Only Tick Pose When Rendered as the project default,
  budget allocator or URO (never both), one LOD Settings asset with hysteresis (Lake [00:21:13];
  AnimBP doc).
- **Control Rig: Construction caches, Forwards Solve per frame.** Profile before converting to C++
  (60 µs graph vs 10 to 16 µs rig unit); FBIK adjusts a pose, it does not create one; exclude bones
  instead of locking them; a Backwards Solve makes a rig bakeable (Stéphane Biava, XYMad1EutcA
  [00:10:08]; LEGO Fortnite tech animator, kO6pz8ADgcU [00:12:04]).
- **Never ship the cinematic MetaHuman.** About 800 MB cooked vs about 60 MB Optimized High;
  audition LODs at the game camera (DeVoe, tTgMafRAM7A [00:15:16], [00:23:34]).

## Authoring surfaces (run on 5.8.3)

- **Epic MCP first** for skeletal mesh facts and sockets (`SkeletalMeshTools`), physics assets
  (`PhysicsAssetToolset`), Control Rig hierarchy and graphs (`ControlRigTools`) and Control Rig keys
  in a Level Sequence (`SequencerControlRigTools`, `SequencerKeyframingTools`). Four or more toolset
  calls in a row go through one `ProgrammaticToolset.execute_tool_script`:
  [`references/mcp-animation.md`](references/mcp-animation.md) has each recipe as a script (a
  physics asset pass is 1 call instead of 12) plus the signatures; do not `describe_toolset`.
- **Python** ([`ue_anim`](scripts/ue_anim.py), next to MCP or headless) for everything no toolset
  writes: AnimSequence keys (`create_keyed_sequence`), montages and notifies (`create_montage`),
  root motion, imports with explicit pipelines, IK Rigs, retargeters, batch retarget, AnimBP
  settings, facts for the offline checks.
- **Control Rig bakes:** `export_anim_sequence` gave one pose at every frame, headless and
  offscreen; a GUI bake is not yet run. Key agent-made clips directly (`create_keyed_sequence`).

## Workflow

1. **Probe once per engine.** `job_00_anim_probe.py` headless. GATE: `probe.json` lists IK Rig,
   retargeter, Pose Search, AnimPose, Interchange, MetaHuman names and whether 5.8
   `BlueprintGraphEditor` exists.
2. **Receive and audit the character.** `A.import_character` / `A.import_animations` (explicit
   Interchange options; an empty result carries the log errors), then
   `A.import_audit(A.skeletal_mesh_facts(mesh))`: one root, unused bones (5.8 Bone Count Reduction),
   influences over 8, units. Set project-wide import defaults once:
   `A.apply_ini_plan(cfg, A.import_defaults_plan())` for the legacy importer, the project pipeline
   in the Interchange Import Content stack. GATE: no error; mesh looked at in a neutral lit preview.
3. **Choose the transfer.** `A.transfer_method(source, target)`. GATE: method and reason written
   down.
4. **IK Rigs.** `A.create_ik_rig` (5.8 template: 29 chains on the mannequin; on unknown names zero,
   then `A.biped_chain_plan`). GATE: `A.chain_map_check` clean.
5. **Retargeter, built once, then templated.** `A.create_retargeter`; op settings once in the GUI,
   saved as `RTG_Template`; Pin Bones from
   `A.ik_bone_pin_plan(bones, A.mannequin_bone_map(bones, parents))`. GATE:
   `A.op_stack_check(ops, proportions_differ=True, target_ik_bones=..., runtime=..., profile_ops_us=...)`
   clean; `A.retarget_log_check` on the Retarget Output Log clean; LOD thresholds and Profile Ops
   for any runtime retargeter.
6. **Batch retarget and clean.** `A.batch_retarget(..., retain_additive=True)`; mocap through its
   own retargeter (Filter Bones, Generate From Target Pelvis); `A.anim_content_audit`,
   `A.ensure_root_motion`, `A.strip_curves`. GATE: `A.compare_contact` on walk, run, turn, crouch,
   jump, a contact clip and a mocap clip; `A.root_motion_check`; contact frames looked at side and
   front.
7. **Movement model and authored clips.** Tune the movement component per gait and direction; export
   the capsule trajectory (5.6+ Rewind Debugger > Trajectories export, else Take Recorder) to
   scenario-maya-animation or scenario-blender-animation. GATE: `A.capsule_match` (root on the path,
   chest within tolerance, root stops with the capsule) and `A.speed_parity` on returned clips.
8. **Locomotion architecture.** `A.decide_locomotion(...)`. Motion matching: migrate GASP,
   `A.motion_matching_coverage` (foot pairs, capture shapes), `A.database_plan`, duplicate schemas
   and databases, then remap every mannequin bone name:
   `A.schema_bone_check(A.schema_facts(s)["bones"], bones, bone_map)`, Pose History bones in the
   GUI; tags, notify filtering, repetition guards. Procedural nodes: `A.procedural_order_check`,
   `A.offset_root_bone_modes`. GATE: zero "no database" warnings cycling every state in PIE; Rewind
   Debugger read on each transition frame; starts, stops, pivots at 0.25 timescale from a still
   camera.
9. **Root motion and montages.** `A.root_motion_mode_check(mode, multiplayer, montage_root_motion)`;
   `A.montage_blend_out_check`; traversal tails through a JustTraversed database. GATE: no root
   velocity in the blend-out window; `show collision` capsule stays with the mesh; game thread
   measured.
10. **Foot IK.** GASP 5.4 leg IK only locks feet to the IK foot bones, no ground adaptation [verify
    current GASP]; slopes and stairs need Foot Placement or a Control Rig with FBIK
    (`A.fbik_foot_defaults(mannequin_like=False)` re-derives the knee axis). Sequencer shots:
    `CR_GroundAlignment` on the mannequin, then retarget. GATE: stairs and 30 degree slope captures,
    foot gap per frame, no pop, no jitter.
11. **Performance pass.** `A.anim_ini_plan`, `A.animbp_settings`, `A.compile_and_scan`,
    `A.allocator_config_check`, `A.lod_settings_check`. GATE: `stat anim`, `stat unit`, Insights
    before and after on the same path.
12. **Deliver** per Handoffs, with what was not verified.

## Live traps (run on 5.8.3)

- `SequencerControlRigTools` setters key nothing until the sequence is open
  (`SequencerTools.open_sequence`), return true for control names that do not exist, and
  Euler-transform controls (117 of 148 on CR_Mannequin_Body) need `set_euler_transform`, not
  `set_rotator`. Read `get_controls_info` first.
- `PhysicsAssetToolset.CreateFromMesh` takes the package path, not `/Pkg.Asset`; on an existing
  `<Mesh>_PhysicsAsset` it returns it unchanged.
- `SkeletalMeshTools.get_bone_names` and `ControlRigTools.import_bones_from_asset` give the
  Skeleton's bones (161 on SK_Mannequin), not the mesh's (89 on SKM_Manny_Simple).
- The IK Rig auto template returns without error and makes zero chains on a skeleton it does not
  know: count chains (`create_ik_rig` falls back to `biped_chain_plan`).
- Imports refused by Interchange return an empty list and no exception; the reason is in the log
  (the helpers return it). Forcing 30 Hz refuses a clip that is not frame-aligned at 30: keep the
  source rate.
- `AnimationLibrary.get_num_frames` counts intervals (keys = frames + 1); the rate is on
  `data_model_interface`. `unreal.Rotator` positional order is (roll, pitch, yaw).

## Quality gates

- **Code:** the `A.*` checks of each Workflow gate, summarized by `verdict(issues)` with no error.
- **Engine numbers:** `stat anim`, `stat unit`, Insights (animation channel, game-thread AnimGraph
  update), stat group PoseSearch (5.8 names), `a.Budget.Debug.Enabled 1`, Retarget Profile Ops.
- **Visual (ue_review):** contact frames side and front, native in the middle, 0.25 timescale
  locomotion, stairs and slopes, LOD at distance. Score with
  [`references/critique.md`](references/critique.md).

## Handoffs

- **Receives** from the Maya and Blender rigging and animation skills via
  scenario-unreal-pipeline-automation: FBX 2020.2, cm, one root at the origin, joints only, one clip
  per file, `game_skeleton_check` JSON. Blender files come from scenario-blender-export's
  `unreal_skeletal` preset.
- **Delivers to scenario-maya-animation or scenario-blender-animation:** exported capsule
  trajectory, speed, acceleration and braking per direction, stop spec, chest tolerance, clip list
  with both feet.
- **Delivers to scenario-unreal-gameplay:** character Blueprint child (GASP or Lyra), AnimBP
  variable contract (gait, stance, movement mode, rotation mode), montages with warp targets,
  movement model values; CMC input acceleration needs C++ replication for multiplayer trajectories.
- **Delivers to scenario-unreal-cinematics:** retargeted clips, bakeable Control Rigs,
  `CR_GroundAlignment` guidance, MetaHuman Cine tier only for pre-rendered shots.
- **Asks scenario-unreal-performance** for the budget and captures.

## UE 5.8 notes

- Retargeter: op stack (5.6), Override Sets replace Retarget Profiles, foot definition and floor
  constraint, Blend to Source, Scale Goals, Offset Goals as separate Run IK Rig sub-ops; resave
  pre-5.8 retargeters.
- Pose Search: `DatabaseAnimationAssets` (5.7), Chooser-column databases default to Brute Force,
  `...FromContext` channel getters, renamed stats, "Block Transition In".
- `unreal.BlueprintGraphEditor` exists on 5.8.3; whether it reaches AnimGraph nodes is [verify] (not
  tried): use a copy, else templates.
- Interchange imports skeletal FBX from Python on 5.8.3 (`import_character`); pass options
  explicitly.
- Control Rig: Construction Event; Physics Beta; `FSmartName` and 5.0 to 5.6 anim APIs removed.
- MetaHuman: `ConvertLegacyDNAAssets -DryRun` first; face MetaHuman Animator on macOS, body Windows
  only.
- Experimental (keep a fallback): Animation Mixer, Direct Mesh Controls, uFBX, MetaHuman Crowd,
  MotionMatchMulti, Mover.
