# Roblox Studio Expert Skills

Agent skills that let Claude (Claude Code) or Codex build in Roblox Studio the way the experts in
the best tutorials, Roblox Developers Conference talks and official documentation do. Built on
2026-10-18 and 2026-10-19 with the same method as [Godot Expert Skills](../godot/README.md) and
[Unity Expert Skills](../unity/README.md): transcripts of top-rated videos, cited expert notes, then
skills with tools and review rubrics, graded blind against the same model without them. Every
procedure was also run live in Roblox Studio 0.743 through its built-in MCP server. Start with the
lead skill, `scenario-roblox-expert`.

## Status

- 14 skills (the lead `scenario-roblox-expert`, which carries the shared Python toolkit `rbx_*` and
  the Luau AgentKit, plus 13 specialists) written from 214 expert videos with transcripts and 85
  documentation pages and articles. Each specialist has references, a Python module and Luau kit
  code.
- Verified live: every procedure was run in Roblox Studio 0.743 on macOS (Apple Silicon), on local
  places that were never published. The runs used Luau in Edit through the MCP server, playtests
  with Server and Client code, simulated keys, mouse and walking, captures that were looked at, and
  Rojo builds. Every skill's offline suite (luau and Lune, both Luau type solvers, Rojo builds,
  Python units) passes too. Per-skill live counts as reported by each skill's own suite:

- Blind-graded written scenarios (12 production briefs): 60 % without the skills (108/180), 97 %
  with them (174/180). All twelve scenarios improved. One grader per scenario and one answer per
  condition, so read it as a direction, not a statistic. Both agents wrote plans without driving
  Studio. Every point both answers missed went back into its skill before the live suites were
  rerun. Two scenarios were regraded once after that refactor (code architecture and gameplay, 13 to
  15 each).
- Not run: publishing, Open Cloud calls against a live experience, Marketplace and UGC uploads
  (avatar items were taken up to Roblox's validation only), real purchases, ads, analytics and
  configs on a published experience, live DataStores (the data layer ran against a simulated
  multi-server backend), multi-client tests (each MCP playtest is one client), Team Create, phones,
  consoles and VR, and Windows. Each skill lists what it could not run.

## In Studio

The [live evidence](../../../tests/scenario-roblox-expert/evidence/README.md) shows the skills' own
test runs: four screen recordings, 30 screenshots with their test numbers, a one-page PDF per skill,
a 3-page overview and the blind-test table. Each GIF below links to its MP4.

## Requirements

- Roblox Studio 0.743 or later (`brew install --cask robloxstudio`; it updates itself), signed in to
  a Roblox account. Turn on its MCP server once: Assistant, then Manage MCP Servers, then "Enable
  Studio as MCP server". Tested on macOS (Apple Silicon) only: the toolkit's process, window and GPU
  checks use macOS commands.
- Python 3.9+ (system `python3`) for the runner-side toolkit; the core uses the standard library.
  Optional: Pillow (capture checks), Blender 5.2 (animation and asset preparation), ffmpeg (audio
  preparation).
- File tooling for the offline checks and Rojo projects: Rojo 7.7, luau 0.743, Lune 0.11, Selene
  0.32, StyLua 2.6 and luau-lsp 1.70 (`brew install` or Rokit).

The lead skill `scenario-roblox-expert` explains the execution channels: the Studio MCP server in
Edit, playtests driven by code, offline Luau checks, Rojo files, headless RunScript and Open Cloud
Luau Execution. It also caps how many place windows run at once and waits while the machine is
loaded.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill scenario-roblox-expert scenario-roblox-animation scenario-roblox-architecture scenario-roblox-assets scenario-roblox-data scenario-roblox-environment scenario-roblox-gameplay scenario-roblox-luau scenario-roblox-monetization scenario-roblox-networking scenario-roblox-performance scenario-roblox-tooling scenario-roblox-ui scenario-roblox-vfx-audio
```

The installer puts the skills side by side, which the specialists need: they import the lead skill's
`scripts/` (Python toolkit and Luau AgentKit). In the installer picker
(`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills`), the family is the "Expert tools: Roblox Studio" group.
Update with `npx skills update`.

## Provenance

Built for this repository in Emmanuel de Maistre's build project, with no separate skills
repository. The skills were written with this repository's names, frontmatter (`name`,
`description`, `license`) and sibling-install line from the start.

Paths such as `tests/code/...`, `tests/places/...` or `tests/live_evidence/...` inside the skills
point to the build project (tests, live evidence) on the author's machine; they are provenance only
and are not part of this repo.
