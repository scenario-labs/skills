# Roblox Tooling and Build Pipeline

Target line: Roblox Studio (October 2026 build) on macOS, driven through the scenario-roblox-expert
toolkit.

Expert level here means a repository that rebuilds every place from empty, a gate seen failing
before it is trusted, and one spec format for Lune and the engine. Only an approved release job
publishes.

If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it
(`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and
flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-roblox-expert (channels, review loop, toolkit, current-Roblox
traps).

## Stance (the expert delta)

1. **Build the place from the repository.** Never publish a dev place edited by hand: a deleted
   object would ship silently (CJ_Oyer, Connect 2023, 00:42:51).
2. **The gate exists to fail.** Type and lint errors block the publish; that catches the typo class
   of bugs, "90 percent" in his words, not design bugs, so keep a playtest before big releases
   (CJ_Oyer 00:12:50 to 00:13:55). [added] Plant one fault per check and watch exactly that step
   turn red before trusting green.
3. **Only the pipeline publishes, all places together.** People and agents get repository access
   (CJ_Oyer 00:22:44). An old place reading a newer DataStore shape errors, so every place ships in
   one run (00:26:27). [added] Upload all places as Saved first, then promote all to Published.
4. **One sync tool per folder.** Script Sync suits code-only, Studio-centric teams; Rojo suits
   whole-project builds, Wally and CI (Distracted Games, 2026; Script Sync docs). Rojo can still run
   beside Script Sync as a sourcemap generator only (xlxnmAFmu6c 00:12:57).
5. **Packages are code you ship.** Wally packages can arrive mis-packaged, with no entry module;
   require the real entry (`lib`) or copy the module (xlxnmAFmu6c 00:01:44). ShipCheck
   `package-entry` fails on such a package.
6. **One spec format, two runtimes.** [added] A spec requires its subject by string
   (`require("./Damage")`), so the same file runs under `lune run` and in Studio or Open Cloud. Pure
   logic runs in Lune in milliseconds; engine facts run in the engine.
7. **Verify by code, not by eye.** The official setup video has the agent touch every synced folder,
   read `InstanceFileSyncService:GetStatus` and playtest before any commit (Roblox Learn, 2026,
   02:45 to 03:34). Script Sync can stop silently (SmartyRBX, 00:12:19): poll status.
8. **Typed Luau for agents.** roblox-ts loses Studio editing, Luau line numbers and fast API typings
   (Adam, Last Level Studios, 00:06:01); agents driving Studio through MCP stay on strict Luau.

## Establish first

- **Sync tool in use:** a `*.project.json` (Rojo) or Script Sync links
  (`InstanceFileSyncService:GetAllInstances()` not empty). Never add the second one on the same
  folder.
- **Who owns the map:** Rojo cannot live-sync Terrain, CSG or `MeshPart.MeshId`, so builders' work
  reaches the release as `.rbxmx` files in the project or as a base place merged with the code build
  (P15).
- **Who edits what:** builders in Team Create on a build experience; scripters in the repository,
  one owner per synced script, since two people syncing one script overwrite each other (Script Sync
  docs); only the release job holds the production key (P16).
- **Places of the experience:** universe id, place ids, start place. They go in `places.json`.
- **CI host and keys:** GitHub Actions by default. The user creates every key; an agent never
  creates, prints or stores one. One key per job, only its scopes (table below); for a group
  experience, keys on a dedicated account with a minimal group role; IP restriction off for
  GitHub-hosted runners, whose IPs change (API keys guide; CJ_Oyer 00:38:26).
- **A test universe** separate from production for engine tests [added]: Luau Execution DataStore
  calls hit real data.
- **Defaults when unstated:** the template below, `emitLegacyScripts: false`, client entry as a
  RunContext Client Script in `ReplicatedStorage.Client`, strict mode, tabs.

## Procedure

Full code, tests and results: [procedures.md](references/procedures.md). Runner script:
[rbx_tooling.py](scripts/rbx_tooling.py).

1. **Scaffold.** `python3 scripts/rbx_tooling.py scaffold <repo> --name <game>`, then
   `rokit install` and `wally install`. It copies the [template](scripts/template/) and the
   [TestRunner](scripts/agentkit/tooling/TestRunner.luau) and
   [ShipCheck](scripts/agentkit/tooling/ShipCheck.luau) modules into `tools/testkit/`. GATE:
   `rbx_tooling.py lint <repo>/default.project.json` reports no error (it also catches properties
   Rojo drops silently).
2. **Local gate.** `rbx_tooling.py gate <repo>` runs the CI steps in order: Wally,
   `rojo sourcemap --include-non-scripts`, luau-lsp twice, Selene, StyLua, Lune tests, ship build,
   ShipCheck. luau-lsp 1.70.1 runs the old solver unless given `--flag:LuauSolverV2=true`, while
   Studio uses the new one for nonstrict scripts, so the gate runs both (P2). GATE: every step exits
   0, then each planted fault (type, solver-only, lint, format, failing spec, test in release) fails
   exactly its steps.
3. **Engine tests in Studio.** Build a dev place and open it once with `rbx_env.open_place` inside
   `rbx_env.place_slot()` (binding: the lead's procedures). Then `rbx_tooling.check_target(s)`
   checks through `list_roblox_studios` that one window is bound and holds a test place (P18);
   allowlist the Studio MCP tools first, or each call stalls on a prompt (coding harness tutorial).
   Run the CI one-liner through `rbx_run.run` in Edit, then on the Server in a `Playtest`:
   ```luau
   return require(game:GetService("ServerStorage").TestKit.EngineTests)()
   ```
   GATE: `failed == 0` and `total > 0`. A spec that fails to load counts as a failure.
4. **Client placement probe.** Before trusting a layout, count client script runs in a playtest
   (P7). GATE: each entry runs once per player.
5. **Sync health** (Script Sync teams).
   `rbx_tooling.run_kit(studio, "return SyncCheck.run(game)", kit=["SyncCheck"])` with
   [SyncCheck](scripts/agentkit/tooling/SyncCheck.luau), and `rbx_tooling.lint_scriptsync(folder)`
   on disk. GATE: no error findings; every root reads SyncedAsRoot.
6. **CI.** Commit [ci.yml](scripts/template/.github/workflows/ci.yml): a `static` job with no
   secrets on every pull request, and an `engine` job for pushes and same-repository pull requests.
   The engine job checks its key and scopes (`tools/check_key.luau --require-scope ...`), uploads
   the dev build as a Saved version of a test place, and runs the one-liner through Open Cloud Luau
   Execution (`tools/cloud_luau.luau --expect-tests`).
   - A place accepts 10 unfinished tasks, then HTTP 429 (Open Cloud reference): engine jobs share
     one concurrency group and `cloud_luau` retries 429 with backoff. GATE:
     `rbx_tooling.check_workflow` ok and actionlint 0; the first pull request is green, and a
     planted fault turns it red.
7. **Release.** [publish.yml](scripts/template/.github/workflows/publish.yml) runs on a tag or by
   hand in the protected `production` environment: key check, `tools/place_versions.luau` (newest
   Version History number of each builders' place), ship build,
   `tools/merge_place.luau --manifest places.json --live-versions ...` (each base place plus the
   code, then ShipCheck), then `tools/publish.luau --manifest places.json --published`. P10 quotes
   the whole job.
   - Builders hand over with **File** > **Save to File** into `assets/<place>.rbxl` and record that
     save's Version History number as `baseVersion` (P15). An outdated copy silently ships the old
     map, so the merge refuses a `baseVersion` older than the newest version.
   - The place publishing API does not update PartOperation (CSG), SurfaceAppearance, EditableImage,
     EditableMesh or BaseWrap content (place publishing guide): `merge_place` exits 2 on them and
     keeps the merged file for a person to publish from Studio.
   - Restarting outdated servers (`tools/restart_servers.luau`, Open Cloud `:restartServers`) runs
     only when a manual run sets `restart_servers`. GATE: merge exit 0 with `freshness` checked and
     `dropped` and `baseScripts` reviewed; Saved versions exist for every place before any Published
     upload. Agents run phase 1 or `--dry-run` only, and never restart servers.
8. **Studio command line on a CI Mac.** Use the lead's wrapper `rbx_run.run_headless(place, code)`:
   it refuses while any Studio runs and parses a result marker (no live run yet).
   `RobloxStudio --task RunScript` itself (4 runs here, 6.0 s each) exits 0 even on a runtime error
   and, on macOS, took over the open Studio and closed its window (P12). GATE: the parsed marker,
   never RunScript's exit code.

API keys, one per job; scope strings from the Open Cloud reference; each job's
`check_key --require-scope` list matches its row (P13):

## Quality gates

Measurable:

- Gate report ok, plus the red proofs (P2).
- Lune: `tests: N passed, 0 failed` with N above 0; engine: the same counts from EngineTests.
- ShipCheck on the ship build: no findings; dev build: `dev-container` and `test-code` only.
- `check_workflow` ok on both workflows; no `secrets.` inside a `run:` line.
- SyncCheck ok; P7 probe counts 1 per entry.

Visual: none for the pipeline. Script Sync conflict dialogs and the Rojo Connect prompt are GUI
modals `screen_capture` misses: ask the user ([gui-paths.md](references/gui-paths.md)). Score with
[critique.md](references/critique.md).

## Handoffs

- **scenario-roblox-expert:** channels, `rbx_run.run_headless`, places and slots. Tooling never
  reimplements them.
- **scenario-roblox-architecture:** folder layout and RunContext choices; tooling maps them into
  project files and probes them (P7).
- **scenario-roblox-luau:** fixes the findings of both solvers; strict mode is set in `.luaurc`.
- **scenario-roblox-networking:** exploit and validation specs run as engine tests in CI.
- **scenario-roblox-data:** DataStore specs, on a test universe only.
- **scenario-roblox-assets:** content the publish API cannot update (step 7) sends that release
  through Studio.
- **scenario-roblox-performance:** receives the ShipCheck report and Saved version numbers, and owns
  publishing, updates and shutdowns.

## Current Roblox notes

- Studio has a built-in MCP server and Open Cloud has Luau Execution: the 2023 claim "no Roblox
  runtime in CI" is outdated.
- Rokit replaces Aftman and Foreman; TestEZ and run-in-roblox are 2023 tools.
- IP restriction on keys is optional now; the `0.0.0.0` and runner-IP workarounds in older videos
  are obsolete.
