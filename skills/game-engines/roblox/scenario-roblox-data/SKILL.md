# Roblox Data and Backend

Roblox Studio (October 2026 build) on macOS, driven through the scenario-roblox-expert toolkit.

Expert level here means the data layer stays correct when a server crashes, a write fails after it
landed, or two servers want the same player. Prove those cases against a simulated multi-server
backend before any published test, because an unpublished place cannot reach DataStores at all.

If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, load it with `skill_get`
(Scenario MCP) or ask the user to install it (https://github.com/scenario-labs/skills#install);
unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-roblox-expert (channels, review loop, toolkit, current-Roblox
traps).

## Stance (the expert delta)

1. **Session locks stop duplication, UpdateAsync alone does not.** One ProfileStore profile per
   player holds the lock (loleris, ProfileStore docs). `UpdateAsync` is safer than `SetAsync` only
   when the transform reads the old value (Suphi Kaner, 00:04:43).
2. **A failed write may have landed.** Read with `UseCache = false` before redoing it (Roblox best
   practices). Put an operation id inside the value so a repeat is a no-op [added]. With 30% of
   writes failing after they landed, naive retries stored 39 for 30 operations in the mock run.
3. **Retries on one key stay in order.** A late retry of an old value overwrites newer data (Roblox
   best practices). `KeyQueue` serializes per key.
4. **A purchase is granted once and confirmed saved.** Log each `PurchaseId` in the profile. Return
   `PurchaseGranted` only when `LastSavedData` holds it (Rileybytes, 00:29:08; Roblox purchasing
   doc). Every other path returns `NotProcessedYet`.
5. **Migrate before `Reconcile`.** `Reconcile` copies the template's `SchemaVersion` into old data,
   and the migration is skipped [added, proven against the real ProfileStore].
6. **Old servers never save newer data.** During an update, old and new servers run side by side.
   Refuse a higher `SchemaVersion`, release the lock untouched, and kick [added]. Publish every
   place of a multi-place game together (CJ_Oyer, 00:27:33).
7. **Two profiles never save atomically.** Editing both without a yield protects memory only
   (loleris). Escrow both sides, then let one trade-log record decide [added]. Without escrow a
   crash between the two saves duplicated a Shield and lost a Sword.
8. **Test against an injected store.** Write the data code so `DataStoreService` can be swapped for
   `MockDataStore` and run several simulated servers with the unmodified ProfileStore [added].

## Establish first

- **Published, and Studio API access on?** Unpublished: every DataStore call throws, so test with
  mocks. Published with access on: Studio writes live keys, so use a separate test experience
  (Roblox docs) or `ProfileStore.Mock`.
- **What persists where.** Player state goes in one profile. Leaderboards use an `OrderedDataStore`.
  Matchmaking and short-lived shared state use MemoryStore. Announcements use MessagingService.
- **Trading, Developer Products, multi-place?** Each adds a stage below.
- **Peak CCU, players per server, profile size.** Feed `rbx_data.budget`.
- **Data already live?** Then keys and store names are frozen; every change becomes a migration
  step.

Defaults: ProfileStore at the pinned commit, store `PlayerData`, key `Player_<UserId>`, a
`SchemaVersion` field, a 100-entry `PurchaseIds` log.

## Procedure

Modules live in `scripts/agentkit/data/` and have no requires. Inline them with
`rbx_data.run(studio, code, dm, data=[...])`, or build them into a place with
`rbx_data.build_place(dir)`. Full code and results: [procedures.md](references/procedures.md).

1. **Probe the environment.** Goal: know which services answer here. How:
   `rbx_data.probe_services(studio, "Edit")`, then `"Server"` in a playtest. GATE: the error texts
   are recorded, and the store choice (real or mock) follows from them.
2. **Design the schema.** Goal: a profile that saves as-is and grows safely. How:
   `DataCheck.report(template)` and a maxed sample, `DataCheck.key(key, {userId})`. GATE: zero error
   findings, size under 25% of 4,194,304 characters, and a JSON round trip equal to the input.
3. **Plan the budget.** Goal: no throttling at peak. How:
   `rbx_data.budget(players, ccu, kb, saves_per_min)`. GATE: `ok` is true at peak CCU, and the
   per-key writes per minute cover autosave plus purchases.
4. **Wire sessions.** Goal: one owner per profile. How: `PlayerData` runs `StartSessionAsync` with
   `Cancel`, kicks on nil, then `AddUserId`, migrate, `Reconcile`, a kick on `OnSessionEnd`, and
   `EndSession` on leave. GATE: the `sessions` suite passes, and a playtest shows the profile loaded
   with `DataStoreState` "NoAccess".

```lua
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local ServerStorage = game:GetService("ServerStorage")
local ProfileStore = require(ServerStorage.Packages.ProfileStore)
local PlayerData = require(ServerStorage.DataKit.PlayerData)
local Migrate = require(ServerStorage.DataKit.Migrate)

local data = PlayerData.new({
	ProfileStore = ProfileStore,
	Players = Players,
	storeName = "PlayerData",
	template = { SchemaVersion = 2, Coins = 0, Inventory = {}, PurchaseIds = {} },
	migrate = Migrate.new({
		latest = 2,
		steps = {
			-- v1 kept owned items as an array of names; v2 counts them by id.
			[2] = function(d: any)
				d.Inventory = d.Inventory or {}
				for _, item in ipairs(d.Items or {}) do
					d.Inventory[item] = (d.Inventory[item] or 0) + 1
				end
				d.Items = nil
			end,
		},
	}),
})
data:Start()
```

5. **Version the schema.** Goal: old data upgrades once. How: `Migrate.new{latest, steps}`, one
   fixture per old version. GATE: the `schema` suite passes, including the Reconcile trap and the
   "newer" refusal.
6. **Grant purchases.** Goal: exactly one grant per `PurchaseId`. How:
   `Receipts.new{getProfile, isPresent, handlers}`; assign `ProcessReceipt` in one script. GATE: the
   `receipts` suite passes with ghost writes, crashes and server changes.
7. **Raw stores.** Goal: leaderboards, counters and logs that survive retries. How:
   `KeyQueue.new(store)` with an op id in the value and a `verify` function. GATE: the `keyqueue`
   suite passes.
8. **Trades.** Goal: no item created or lost by a crash. How: `Trade.paidTradingAllowed` for both
   players (PolicyService `IsPaidItemTradingAllowed`, fail closed),
   `Trade.new{log = KeyQueue.new(tradeLogStore)}`, `trade:Recover(profile)` in `onLoaded`. GATE: the
   `trade` suite passes at every crash stage.
9. **Teleports.** Goal: parties arrive together. How: `SafeTeleport.new{TeleportService}`,
   `TeleportParty` for groups. GATE: the `teleport` suite passes against the fake service; a real
   teleport needs a published experience.
10. **Audit.** Goal: no known mistake left in the code. How: `DataAudit.place(game)` in Edit, or
    `rbx_data.py audit place.rbxl` offline. GATE: zero error findings outside test fixtures.
11. **Operate.** Rollbacks with `PlayerData:Restore` (ProfileStore `VersionQuery`), final edits in
    `OnLastSave`, RTBF templates with `rbx_data.rtbf_config`: procedures 13 to 15.
12. **Prove and report.** Run the offline suites, then the same suites in Studio Edit through
    `rbx_run`, then the playtest checks. List what still needs a published place.

## Quality gates

- `run_offline.sh`: all Lune suites pass, rbx_check reports zero errors in kit, place and snippets.
- `run_live.py`: the same suites pass in Studio Edit, and the playtest checks pass.
- `DataAudit`: zero error findings outside fixtures.
- Console: one "[ProfileStore]: Roblox API services unavailable" line in an unpublished playtest,
  and no save errors.
- Published test experience (later): two real servers hand a player over in under 5 s.

## Handoffs

- From scenario-roblox-architecture: where the data service lives and how systems read it.
- From scenario-roblox-monetization: product ids and amounts. Back: the `Receipts` handler table.
- From scenario-roblox-networking: validated trade and shop requests. Back: `Trade` and inventory
  calls.
- To scenario-roblox-ui and scenario-roblox-gameplay: values exposed as Attributes or signals, never
  raw profiles.
- To scenario-roblox-performance: shutdown timing and update publishing.
- To scenario-roblox-tooling: the Lune suites for CI.
- To scenario-roblox-luau: types for the template.

## Current Roblox notes

- DataStore limits became experience-wide on 2026-07-29; old answers quote 60 + 10 x players and a 6
  s cooldown, both gone.
- Storage limits are enforced from 2026-04-09.
- `HttpService:JSONEncode` encodes NaN and infinity as tagged objects since 2026-03-10, and drops
  sparse and mixed entries silently (live test).
- ProfileService is unsupported; use ProfileStore. DataStore2 is legacy.
- `ReserveServerAsync` replaces `ReserveServer`.
- Studio API access: File > Experience Settings > Security > Enable Studio Access to API Services,
  published games only.
- Studio budgets do not follow the server formulas: a one-player playtest read 585.
