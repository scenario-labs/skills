# Roblox Luau Engineering

Roblox Studio (October 2026 build) on macOS, driven through the scenario-roblox-expert toolkit.

Expert Luau here means code that stays correct under Deferred events and the task scheduler,
type-checks on both solvers, releases everything it creates, and earns each optimization with a
number measured on this build. Prove behavior in a playtest data model instead of reasoning from
Immediate-era habits.

If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it
(`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and
flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-roblox-expert (channels, review loop, toolkit, current-Roblox
traps).

## Stance (the expert delta)

1. **`task.spawn` is not concurrency.** It runs the body up to its first yield before the caller
   continues (Crusherfire). Use `task.defer` for "after this step": a queue that keeps call order.
   `task.wait()` and `task.delay(0)` resume at the next Heartbeat: the same frame from
   PreSimulation, the next frame from Heartbeat (Crusherfire; measured 0.07 ms vs 16.4 ms).
2. **Write Deferred-safe code.** Handlers run at the next resumption point, never inside `:Fire()`
   or a property set (deferred events docs). Nested fires run in queue order, a listener connected
   inside a handler misses fires from the same step, and `Destroying` or `CharacterRemoving`
   handlers see `Parent` nil (Crusherfire; all measured). Read state inside the handler, use
   `:Once()`, and capture what cleanup needs before `Destroy`. Deferred alone cut one game's frame
   time from 6 to 8 ms to 4 to 5 ms (Drew Hamilton, RDC 2026).
3. **Yield only where it is legal and cheap.** Never yield in `__index` or other metamethods,
   `table.sort` comparators or `gsub` callbacks: "attempt to yield across metamethod/C-call
   boundary". Never yield in per-frame handlers: `task.wait(0.25)` in Heartbeat stacked 16 threads
   in 1 s [added, measured]. `pcall` is no fix: a failed `task.wait` under `pcall` left its thread
   registered with the scheduler [added, measured].
4. **Type for both solvers.** New modules start `--!strict`. Define methods as
   `function Class.name(self: Class, ...)`: colon methods let field typos through on both solvers
   [added, tested]. Prefer composition: typed metatable inheritance raises false errors on both.
   Narrow with `IsA` or `FindFirstChildOfClass` instead of `:: any`. Gate on the old and the new
   solver, because strict scripts follow `Workspace.UseNewLuauTypeSolver`, which scripts cannot
   read.
5. **Every object owns its cleanup.** `Destroy` is idempotent and disconnects every connection it
   made (Roblox Learn, OOP). Tables keyed by player are cleared on `PlayerRemoving`. Old characters
   are destroyed: at the Default setting a respawned character was unparented but kept its
   connections (measured). A leak is memory that never comes down; growth alone is not (Roblox
   Learn, memory leaks).
6. **Parallel Luau computes; serial code writes.** One Actor per independent unit, `require` before
   the parallel phase, writes after `task.synchronize()` (docs; Suphi Kaner; Stewiepfing). Each
   Actor is its own Luau VM, so module state is not shared. Read-modify-write on a SharedTable goes
   through `SharedTable.increment` or `update`: a plain `+= 1` from 8 Actors lost 79% of updates
   (measured).
7. **Native code and buffers only after measurement.** `--!native` wins on typed numeric code: 3.3x
   on a number loop, 4.9x on a typed `Vector3` loop, nothing when the `Vector3` parameter is untyped
   (measured; docs say annotate). Native everywhere costs startup and a global memory budget (Roblox
   Learn, native). Buffers pay past about 50 KB/s sustained (Crusherfire), with range checks because
   integer writes wrap silently.
8. **The injected chunk is not the game.** An `execute_luau` chunk on the Server has its own module
   cache: it saw `Counter.n = 0` where game Scripts saw 41 [added, measured]. Read game state
   through attributes or a BindableFunction hook.

## Establish first

- **Signal mode:** Workspace > SignalBehavior. Scripts cannot read it; check the Properties panel,
  the Rojo project file, or `rbx_luau.audit(place)`. `Default` means Immediate. A Rojo-built place
  without the property is Default.
- **Server Authority:** `Workspace.AuthorityMode = Server` forces Deferred and fixed-step
  simulation; game logic then belongs to scenario-roblox-gameplay.
- **Type setup:** `Workspace.LuauTypeCheckMode`, `UseNewLuauTypeSolver`, and whether a Rojo project
  gives a sourcemap.
- **Where code runs:** Server, Client, or under an Actor. Native code helps server scripts only.
- **Baseline numbers** before any optimization: ms per frame of the hot path, KB/s on the wire, heap
  slope per cycle.
- **PlayerCharacterDestroyBehavior** (Properties panel; not scriptable).
- Defaults when unknown: Deferred, `--!strict`, both solvers gated, no native, no Actors, no
  buffers.

## Procedure

1. **Audit what exists.** Goal: find scheduler, yield, deferred, parallel, native and leak mistakes
   before a playtest. How: offline `rbx_luau.audit("place.rbxl" or "src/", "warn")` (Lune); in
   Studio `rbx_luau.run(s, chunk, dm="Edit", kit=["LuauAudit"])` with `LuauAudit.tree(game)`; the
   toolkit's `Audit` covers legacy APIs. GATE: 0 error findings; every warn fixed or justified in
   one line.
2. **Fix the idioms.** Goal: current scheduler and event idioms. How: `task.*` only;
   `PreSimulation`, `PostSimulation`, `PreRender` instead of `Stepped` and `RenderStepped`;
   `:Once()`; yields out of frame handlers (busy flag, or one spawned worker loop); metamethods that
   never yield (precompute, or an explicit `get` that may yield). GATE: audit clean; behavior
   unchanged under Deferred (step 5).
3. **Type pass.** Goal: errors caught at edit time on both solvers. How: `--!strict`, a `Fields`
   type plus `typeof(setmetatable({} :: Fields, Class))`, dot-typed `self`, composition,
   `table.create(n, value)`; then
   `rbx_luau.typecheck(paths, sourcemap=rbx_luau.sourcemap(project))`. GATE: 0 errors in `old` and
   `new`.
4. **Ownership and cleanup.** Goal: nothing outlives its owner. How: the
   [class template](scripts/agentkit/luau/templates/Class.luau) (`Destroy` wired to `Destroying`);
   `PlayerRemoving` cleanup; character destruction. Prove it in a Server playtest with
   `Leak.retained(make, release, n)` and `Leak.sample(cycle, 20)` plus `Leak.slope`. GATE: `alive` 0
   after release; heap slope flat over 20 or more cycles; 0 connections left after `Destroy`.
5. **Probe behavior that depends on order.** Goal: facts from this place, not assumptions. How:
   `Probe.scheduler()`, `Probe.delayTiming()`, `Probe.signals()` through
   `rbx_luau.run(..., dm="Server")` and `dm="Client"` in one playtest
   ([procedures](references/procedures.md) P3). GATE: results recorded; no code depends on an order
   the probe shows Deferred changes.
6. **Optimize only with a number.** Goal: keep only measured wins. How:
   `Bench.run({plain=..., native=...}, 7)` in the Server data model (interleaved rounds, warm-up,
   median); `Parallel.workers` with 1 vs N Actors and a work module; `BufferCodec` size vs the table
   payload. GATE: native ratio 1.2 or more [added threshold], parallel speedup 1.5 or more [added
   threshold], buffers past the bandwidth gate; otherwise revert.
7. **Hand off with evidence.** Goal: a reviewer can trust the result without rerunning it. How:
   attach typecheck output, audit JSON, probe and bench results with build, data model and date; a
   playtest capture through `rbx_review` when the change is visible. GATE: every claim in the
   handoff has a number or a test name.

## Quality gates

Measurable:

- `rbx_luau.typecheck`: 0 errors on both solvers, with the project sourcemap.
- `rbx_luau.audit`: 0 errors; warns resolved.
- Toolkit `Audit`: no legacy scheduler or deprecated API findings.
- `Leak.retained` alive 0 and a flat `Leak.slope` after every cleanup fix.
- Probe results for the place's signal mode recorded on Server and Client.
- Bench and Parallel ratios recorded before keeping native code or Actors.
- `BufferCodec` round trip exact (or within f32 precision) and refusals tested.

Visual (when behavior is visible): a playtest capture through `rbx_review` showing the object
moving, cleaned up, or the state you claim; for profiling claims, a MicroProfiler or Script Profiler
capture taken by hand ([GUI paths](references/gui-paths.md)).

## Handoffs

- **From scenario-roblox-architecture:** module layout, cleanup library choice (Trove, Janitor,
  Maid), signal modules. This skill reviews the Luau inside them.
- **To scenario-roblox-networking:** `BufferCodec` schemas and measured payload sizes; remotes, rate
  limits and wire formats stay there.
- **To scenario-roblox-performance:** Bench and Parallel results, native candidates, leak slopes;
  frame budgets and profiling sessions stay there.
- **From and to scenario-roblox-gameplay:** fixed-step and Server Authority code; this skill
  supplies scheduler and Deferred rules.
- **From scenario-roblox-data:** session state keyed by player; this skill checks `PlayerRemoving`
  cleanup.
- **To scenario-roblox-tooling:** the type gate and `lune_luau_audit.luau` for CI.

## Current Roblox notes

- Deferred is the template default; `Default` still maps to Immediate; Server Authority forces
  Deferred. `SignalBehavior` is NotScriptable.
- New type solver: general release 2025-11-20 for nonstrict and nocheck; strict follows
  `UseNewLuauTypeSolver` (NotScriptable). The old solver stays through 2026.
- `wait`, `spawn`, `delay` are deprecated globals; `Stepped` and `RenderStepped` are superseded.
- Native code generation runs in server scripts; `debug.dumpcodesize()` works only from the Command
  Bar (Server view).
- `vector.create` returns a `Vector3` in Roblox; buffers serialize to JSON as
  `{"m":null,"t":"buffer","base64":...}`.
- `collectgarbage` accepts only `"count"` in Roblox scripts.
