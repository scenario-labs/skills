# Roblox UI and Input

Roblox Studio (October 2026 build) on macOS, driven through the scenario-roblox-expert toolkit.

Expert level here means one UI tree that reads the screen and the player's input at runtime, proven
by numbers and captures on phones in both orientations, a tablet, PCs, a console and a handheld,
without owning any of them. Build the UI as instances in Edit, keep the look in a StyleSheet and the
controls in Input Action System (IAS) contexts, then measure it under Studio's device presets and
drive it with real clicks and keys.

If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it
(`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and
flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-roblox-expert (channels, review loop, toolkit, current-Roblox
traps).

## Stance (the expert delta)

1. **One tree, adapted by measurement.** Never build per-device copies (Roblox mobile roundtable,
   BsyU-SJ9L-c; RDC 2024 frameworks panel). Lay out by `GuiService.ViewportDisplaySize` and show
   prompts by `UserInputService.PreferredInput` (Roblox gamepad doc). Phones take controllers and
   laptops have touch screens (Roblox IAS Q&A, KnFJl6z5UN0 [00:10:42]), so `TouchEnabled` and
   `IsTenFootInterface` guess wrong.
2. **Scale for the shell, Offset for what a thumb or an eye needs.** Panels take Scale capped by a
   `UISizeConstraint`; buttons and text take Offset so they stay legible on a phone (roundtable
   [00:11:15]). Constrain the outer container, not its children (Itz_FloppyFish, BLZl-0cl2DM
   [00:16:37]). A `UIScale` on the whole ScreenGui "breaks everything" (boatbomber, RDC 2024 panel
   [00:38:15]).
3. **The core touch controls and the top bar own their space.** Place custom touch buttons relative
   to the `JumpButton` (Roblox position-and-size doc). The top bar inset measured 58 px on every
   preset in Studio 0.743, while the 2023 roundtable slide said 36 (BsyU-SJ9L-c [00:08:20]). Use
   `ScreenInsets.CoreUISafeInsets` and measure; never hard-code a margin.
4. **The look lives in a StyleSheet.** Tokens hold every repeated value, themes are sheets of
   identically named tokens, and query selectors (`@ViewportDisplaySizeLarge`,
   `@PreferredInputTouch`, `@ReducedMotionEnabledFalse`) adapt it (Roblox Style Editor video,
   _k1ea0OIKaU [00:03:52, 00:04:24]). A property set in code beats every StyleRule (StyleSheet doc;
   measured). A direct read returns the unstyled value: read with `GetStyled`.
5. **Input is a set of contexts switched with the screen.** Gameplay context at Priority 2000, menu
   context at 3000 with `Sink`, enabled only while the menu is open (IAS doc; derpmonster83,
   8nqNw6kSKJ0 [00:08:26]). Priority and Sink live on the context, and equal priorities run in no
   fixed order (KnFJl6z5UN0 [00:17:26, 00:29:33]). Every action gets a key and a gamepad button.
   Touch needs a `UIButton` binding only where nothing on screen does the job (abilities, open menu,
   close); shortcuts for a control the player taps anyway (tab cycling, Confirm for Buy) need none,
   and UIAudit reports them as `ias-no-touch` info. IAS draws no mobile buttons or prompts: you
   build them (KnFJl6z5UN0 [00:13:30]).
6. **A persistent HUD is a direct child of StarterGui with `ResetOnSpawn = false`.** Nested in a
   Folder, the flag is ignored and the HUD resets (on-screen containers doc; measured).
7. **Accessibility is a second channel.** Never encode state by color alone (BitwiseAndrea,
   accessibility roundtable K1pEI6LVJJA [00:29:24]). No chords, no F keys, WASD and arrows both
   (same panel [00:43:15]). Honor `PreferredTransparency`, `ReducedMotionEnabled` and
   `PreferredTextSize` (Roblox accessibility doc). Contrast 4.5:1, or 3:1 for text of 24 px and up
   [added, WCAG].
8. **Plain instances unless the project already runs a framework.** Instances built in Edit are
   visible to the MCP tools, so audits, layout checks and captures run before Play. Choose React
   (jsdotlua), Fusion or Vide when many screens share fast-changing state and a team works in Rojo.
   Then keep game data outside the framework (Leif, Ezk3vEOvv8o [00:13:51]) and benchmark your own
   code, not stress tests (RDC 2024 panel [00:28:11]).

## Procedure

Full code, test ids and results: [references/procedures.md](references/procedures.md). Every stage
runs through [`scripts/rbx_ui.py`](scripts/rbx_ui.py) and the lead's toolkit; L and O ids refer to
`run_live.py`.

1. **Build in Edit (P1).** `rbx_ui.build(s)` installs the catalog, the kit modules, the client
   controller (a `Script` with RunContext Client) and the shop server, then runs
   [BuildMenuHud.luau](scripts/agentkit/ui/templates/BuildMenuHud.luau). The HUD holds status top
   left (display only), the menu button top right and the ability buttons. The menu is a
   `CanvasGroup` panel with tabs in the header and Home, Shop and Settings pages. The shop is a
   `ScrollingFrame` with `AutomaticCanvasSize = Y` and a `UIGridLayout` whose cell size comes from
   the StyleSheet. Dynamic labels set `AutoLocalize = false`. Code never sets a property that a
   StyleRule owns. GATE: 30 items, 2 StyleLinks, 0 selector errors, both ScreenGuis direct children
   of StarterGui with `ResetOnSpawn = false`.
2. **Audit (P2).** `rbx_ui.audit(s)` runs [UIAudit.luau](scripts/agentkit/ui/UIAudit.luau) (20
   rules: resets, insets, constraints, canvas, strokes, selectors, selection, contrast, IAS coverage
   and conflicts, legacy input patterns) and the lead's `Audit.ui`. The same module runs in Lune on
   a place file. GATE: 0 error and 0 warn; a fixture with one fault per rule fires every rule.
3. **Layout matrix (P3).** `rbx_ui.layout_matrix(pt, rbx_ui.DEVICES, scenes, out)` sets nine presets
   through `StudioDeviceSimulatorService` inside the playtest.
   [UILayout.luau](scripts/agentkit/ui/UILayout.luau) `check` then flags offscreen, top bar, safe
   area, core touch control overlap, small targets, overlap, clipped and small text, and each state
   is captured. Drive scenes with Scriptable bindings, because a key or click switches
   `PreferredInput` away from Touch. GATE: 0 warn per device and scene; ability buttons above the
   `JumpButton` on touch; at least one full row of shop cells; contact sheets read.
4. **Mouse (P4).** `pt.mouse` with `instance_path` `"LocalPlayer.PlayerGui.Menu..."` clicks the
   PlayerGui copy. A `UIButton` binding set in Edit follows the clone at runtime. GATE: each click
   changes exactly its attribute; a purchase spends coins on the server once.
5. **Keyboard and contexts (P5).** `pt.keys` presses through the IAS. GATE: the cooldown refuses a
   second use; with the menu open, Q, E and Space never reach gameplay or the jump.
6. **Gamepad as far as Studio reaches (P6).** Start selection with `GuiService:Select(grid)`, move
   with arrow keys, activate with Return, press gamepad buttons through Scriptable bindings, and
   read glyphs and sizes under the `xbox` preset. GATE: focus moves down and right in the grid;
   selecting the last item scrolls the canvas; the xbox glyph reads "X". Thumbsticks, the D-pad,
   ButtonB and the Select button need a controller or the Controller Emulator
   ([gui-paths](references/gui-paths.md)).
7. **Styles and themes (P7).** Swap the theme at runtime with `UIStyle.setTheme`, which repoints the
   design sheet's `StyleDerive`. GATE: both themes 0 `low-contrast`; a code-set Size survives every
   rule.
8. **Preferences and motion (P8).** Multiply decorative transparency by `PreferredTransparency`;
   skip the fade when reduced motion is on. GATE: the panel is opaque on the first frame under
   reduced motion. Volume, camera shake, key rebinding and text size:
   [player-settings.md](references/player-settings.md) with `UISettings`.
9. **Respawn (P9).** Kill the character on the server and compare marks on the HUD before and after.
   GATE: one HUD, state kept, health rebound to the new Humanoid.
10. **Localization (P10).** Translate in place through
    `LocalizationService:GetTranslatorForLocaleAsync("de")`, then add 40% to every localizable
    string, on the two smallest phones. GATE: 0 `text-clipped` on every page in both passes.
11. **Scenario UI art (P12).** Item icons, frames and button skins come from scenario-game-assets as
    transparent PNGs. Upload them only with the user's go, then set `Icon.Image` per cell and
    `ScaleType = Slice` with `SliceCenter` for frames. Keep text out of the art.

## Quality gates

Measurable:

- `run_live.py` L0 to L14 and `run_offline.sh` O1 to O3 pass.
- UIAudit and the lead's `Audit.ui` report 0 warn and 0 error.
- `UILayout.check` reports 0 warn on nine presets in two scenes.
- 0 `text-clipped` in German and pseudo-localization on the two smallest phones; 0 `low-contrast` in
  both themes.
- No console errors from your scripts. FoundationProvider and UIBlox lines come from Studio's own
  core scripts.

Visual: read the HUD and shop contact sheets (at most 1,600 px) against
[critique.md](references/critique.md). Permanent elements, the chat area and shop discovery:
[screen-budget.md](references/screen-budget.md). Check that text is legible, nothing sits under the
touch controls or the top bar, the primary action is the largest button, and rarity reads without
color.

## Handoffs

- In: coins and ownership as player attributes (persistence from scenario-roblox-data), remote
  validation rules (scenario-roblox-networking), ability names and cooldowns
  (scenario-roblox-gameplay), Robux prompts (scenario-roblox-monetization), click and purchase
  sounds (scenario-roblox-vfx-audio), icons, frames and button skins (scenario-game-assets), project
  layout and Rojo (scenario-roblox-architecture, scenario-roblox-tooling).
- Out: InputActions with Scriptable test bindings to scenario-roblox-gameplay; the UI cost on low
  phones to scenario-roblox-performance; screen open and close attributes to
  scenario-roblox-monetization for funnels.

## Current Roblox notes

- The IAS reached full release on 2026-06-11. `InputAction:Fire` is deprecated: fire a Scriptable
  `InputBinding`. Default scripts on IAS are expected by default in early 2027. `BindActivate` and
  the gamepad selection toggle have no IAS form yet (KnFJl6z5UN0 [00:20:15, 00:39:43]).
- `PreferredInput` (2025-10-14) and `ViewportDisplaySize` (2025-08-14) replace device sniffing.
- An unset `InputBinding.KeyCode` reads `None`, not `Unknown` as documented.
  `InputActionLabel.ResolvedText` read empty in a playtest, so glyphs come from
  `InputAction.PreferredBinding` (measured).
- `StudioDeviceSimulatorService` (PluginSecurity) drives the Device Simulator from `execute_luau` in
  Edit and in the playtest Client; the Server is refused. The simulator rotates regardless of
  `ScreenOrientation` (measured).
- A new place reads `ScreenOrientation = LandscapeSensor`; the reference says Sensor.
- `StyleRule.SelectorError` fills a few frames after the Selector changes on a rule already in the
  place; set earlier, a broken selector reads "" (measured).
- `execute_luau` cannot read `PlayerScriptsUseInputActionSystem` or write the `GuiService`
  preferences: set the flag in Rojo, and test preferences through an in-game setting.
- MCP `user_keyboard_input` and `VirtualInput` send keyboard events only: gamepad KeyCodes never
  reach the IAS (measured).
