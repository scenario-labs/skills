# Roblox Networking and Security

Target: Roblox Studio (October 2026 build) on macOS, driven through the scenario-roblox-expert
toolkit.

Expert level here means every client-triggerable action is attacker input: the server owns state,
checks each call in a fixed order, and proves it by firing hostile arguments from a playtest client.
Detection supplements validation, and visible consequences come late, from varied signals.

If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it
(`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and
flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-roblox-expert (channels, review loop, toolkit, current-Roblox
traps).

## Stance (the expert delta)

1. **Remotes carry intent, never results.** The client names an item, and the server prices it. A
   weapon reports origin and hit point, never the victim or the damage (Creator Docs, client-server
   boundary; GnomeCode).
2. **Check in a fixed order: rate, then arguments, then context.** The docs list context, type,
   value and rate; running the rate limit first is cheapest [added]. NaN passes
   `typeof(v) == "number"` and fails every comparison, so use `math.isfinite` (Creator Docs; Suphi
   Kaner). Live, NaN and infinity payloads through a handler that only range-checked set an IntValue
   balance to -9223372036854775808.
3. **An Instance argument is a claim.** Check `typeof` and `IsDescendantOf(expectedFolder)`: a table
   can mimic an Instance, and a client can replay a destroyed pickup it still references (Creator
   Docs; Suphi Kaner).
4. **Every client-triggerable surface is a remote.** ProximityPrompt checks distance on `Triggered`
   only and ignores `Enabled`. ClickDetector has no server checks. `Touched` reports the client's
   physics (Creator Docs; Suphi Kaner).
5. **Movement: Server Authority for new competitive games, a server MoveGuard for existing casual
   places.** The deciding condition is genre plus whether you can adopt fixed simulation,
   InputActions and streaming (Creator Docs; Jason Knight, Roblox). Server Authority does not stop
   ESP, aimbots or camera abuse (ev1).
6. **Validate hits against what the attacker saw.** Roblox has no built-in lag compensation (ev1).
   Rewind server-recorded positions over `[now - min(ping + 0.1, 0.4), now]` [added], or use a cone
   of about 10 degrees (ev1). Obstruction uses static geometry only (Creator Docs).
7. **Consequences climb a ladder and arrive late.** Keep a decaying suspicion score, require two
   distinct reasons before enforcement, and delay visible action randomly by 20 to 90 s [added
   numbers]. Honeypot remotes and direction honeypots are high-confidence signals (Creator Docs,
   server-side detection). For movement, rubber-band instead of kicking, because lag causes false
   positives (GnomeCode).
8. **UnreliableRemoteEvent only for frequent cosmetic data under 1,000 bytes.** The cap is 1,000
   bytes (Creator Docs); the 900 figure in a 2025 Roblox Learn video is outdated, and live a
   980-byte random buffer arrived while 1,000 was dropped. Both remote types need identical
   validation.

## Establish first

- `Workspace.AuthorityMode`: Automatic means client-owned characters (MoveGuard applies); Server
  means the engine simulates them. `rbx_net.audit_place(place)` reads all six settings offline.
- Stakes: competitive or casual, live or prototype. A prototype can defer honeypots and the ladder,
  never validation.
- Remote inventory: name, direction, frequency, payload size, and what server value each handler
  writes.
- Interactive surface: prompts, ClickDetectors, DragDetectors, `Touched` pickups, and whether their
  parents are unanchored.
- Enforcement policy: kick, `Players:BanAsync`, or mitigation only; who handles appeals
  (`Net.reset`).
- Defaults when unanswered: every remote through `Net.bind`, one honeypot, `Net.serverOnly` on
  server-to-client remotes, enforcement as a dry run during tests.

## Procedure

Run each stage through the toolkit; full code and test results are in
[procedures.md](references/procedures.md). Status: 24 live tests pass in Studio 0.743 (arena rerun
and Server Authority place on 2026-10-19). Keep `NetKit` (`Guard`, `RateLimit`, `Suspicion`, `Net`,
`HitCheck`, `MoveGuard`) as ModuleScripts under one server folder; `rbx_net.kit_tree(project_dir)`
gives the Rojo fragment.

1. **Audit.** Goal: a list of every remote, handler and interactive instance with findings. How:
   `rbx_net.audit_place(place)` offline (Lune), then
   `rbx_net.run(studio, "return NetAudit.run(game, Audit)", kit=["NetAudit"], lead_kit=["Audit"])`
   in Edit. GATE: zero errors; every warning fixed or justified; live tally equals offline tally.
2. **Validate and limit.** Goal: no handler runs on bad arguments or at flood rates. How:
   `Net.bind(remote, {args = {Guard...}, limit = {capacity, perSecond}, handler = fn})` for every
   client-to-server remote; idempotent handlers on the server clock. GATE: the audit shows no
   `handler-unvalidated`, `nan-unsafe`, `trusted-value` or `no-rate-limit` finding.
3. **Hits.** Goal: claims checked against history. How: a 1 s `HitCheck.History` per target pushed
   every Heartbeat, `HitCheck.melee` and `HitCheck.ranged` with `ExcludeInstances` or
   `IncludeInstances` for static walls. GATE: out-of-reach, fake-origin, through-wall and offset
   shots rejected; valid shots hit.
4. **Movement.** Goal: speed and teleport hacks neutralized without false positives. How: Server
   Authority (Rojo writes the settings, stage P11), or `MoveGuard.start` with
   `MoveGuard.grace(player, s)` before every server teleport. GATE: honest walk 0 flags; client
   teleport and local WalkSpeed changes rubber-banded (live: WalkSpeed 80 for 2.5 s netted 12.6
   studs on the server). Under Server Authority, live: W held 2 s moved the server character 32.4
   studs, a client teleport 0, local WalkSpeed 80 then W 32.0.
5. **Ownership and surfaces.** Goal: no client-owned part decides an outcome. How:
   `SetNetworkOwner(nil)` on unanchored pickups, NPC roots and prompt parents; `Net.prompt`
   re-checks distance, state and rate; distance checks in `MouseClick` and `Touched`. GATE: a client
   CFrame write moves nothing on the server.
6. **Exploit tests from the Client.** Goal: proof, not intent. How: in a `Playtest`,
   `rbx_net.fuzz(pt, path, gap=...)`, a same-frame spam, a honeypot fire, then `rbx_net.net_log(pt)`
   in the Server data model. Include a deliberately vulnerable remote as a negative control. GATE:
   balances and health unchanged, `ok_<Remote>` equals the valid-case count, no server script error,
   the negative control pays out.
7. **Detection and consequences.** Goal: high-confidence signals, delayed action. How:
   `Net.init({enforce = ..., enforceDelay = {20, 90}})`, `Net.honeypot`, `Net.serverOnly`. GATE: one
   honeypot fire reaches `enforce` with a scheduled delay; a flood alone stays below `restrict`.
8. **Latency.** Goal: valid play survives real ping. How: `rbx_net.set_latency(studio, 100, 100)` in
   Edit before Play, last-moment swings at a moving target. GATE: rewind hit rate at least 0.8. Live
   at 202 ms ping: rewind 13 of 13, no rewind 0 of 13 (three runs). Trigger the swings close to
   reach plus slack: with 0.2 s of margin left, the no-rewind rate swung from 31 to 92 percent
   between runs.
9. **Bandwidth.** Goal: small, on-change traffic. How: `rbx_net.payload_probe` before choosing
   unreliable delivery; pack with `buffer`; sequence numbers on streams. GATE: payloads measured
   under the cap; stream accepted count equals sent.

## Quality gates

Measurable:

- Audit: zero errors; every warning resolved or written down with a reason.
- Fuzz: every hostile case lands in `args_<Remote>` or `rate_<Remote>`; balances, health and pickups
  unchanged.
- Spam: 1,000 same-frame reward fires grant once; purchases never exceed the bucket.
- Hits, movement, ownership, prompts: verdict counters match the test cases (procedures P4 to P6).
- Console during the fuzz: no `ServerScriptService.<script>:<line>` error from your handlers.
- Latency: hit rate at 100 ms each way within 0.2 of the baseline.
- Types: zero errors on both Luau solvers, `luau-lsp analyze` with and without
  `--flag:LuauSolverV2=true`, with a sourcemap built by `rojo sourcemap --include-non-scripts`
  (scenario-roblox-tooling gate).

Visual:

- A client capture during play with no flags from `rbx_review.image_checks`.
- For Server Authority, the visualizer under simulated latency (GUI only,
  [gui-paths.md](references/gui-paths.md)).

Score the result with [critique.md](references/critique.md) before calling it done.

## Handoffs

- Receives from scenario-roblox-architecture: the remote list, folder layout and where state lives.
- Receives from scenario-roblox-gameplay: hitbox, projectile and ability rules to validate.
- Delivers to scenario-roblox-data: validated, finite, size-checked values before any save, plus
  trade and purchase atomicity questions.
- Delivers to scenario-roblox-monetization: grants only from `ProcessReceipt`; the `purchase-signal`
  finding.
- Delivers to scenario-roblox-performance: payload sizes, send rates and the Server Authority
  simulation budget.
- Asks scenario-roblox-luau for buffer packing and Parallel Luau questions, and
  scenario-roblox-tooling for CI wiring of the offline audit.

## Current Roblox notes

- Server Authority reached full release on 2026-07-09. `AuthorityMode` Server sets StreamingEnabled,
  Deferred signals, UseFixedSimulation, NextGenerationReplication and
  PlayerScriptsUseInputActionSystem.
- Scripts cannot read or set those settings from Studio's MCP context ("lacking capability
  RobloxScript"); write them in the Rojo project or the Properties panel. Check them by behavior:
  Deferred signals, input-only movement.
- Inside `BindToSimulation`, use `time()`; `task.defer` leaves the simulation step; effects belong
  in RenderStepped, not in the simulation.
- `RaycastParams.ExcludeInstances` and `IncludeInstances` replace `FilterDescendantsInstances` and
  `FilterType` (2026-04-07); `Blacklist` and `Whitelist` are gone.
- The Network Simulator is in beta and drives `NetworkSettings`; the legacy `IncomingReplicationLag`
  still exists but is not the tool.
- Yielding APIs carry the `Async` suffix (`BanAsync`, `UnbanAsync`, `GetBanHistoryAsync`).
