# Roblox Performance and Release

Target: Roblox Studio (October 2026 build) on macOS, driven through the scenario-roblox-expert
toolkit.

Expert level here means every claim is a number from the side that hurts, taken before and after one
change, and every fix removes work instead of hiding it. Budgets come from the low-end phone, and
Studio numbers are labeled as Studio numbers. Release is part of performance: ship with a restart
plan and a rollback path, and never publish without the owner.

If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it
(`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and
flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-roblox-expert (channels, review loop, toolkit, current-Roblox
traps).

## Stance (the expert delta)

1. **Budget for the low-end phone; label Studio numbers as Studio numbers.** McNeill's budget card
   targets a 2 GB phone: 500 draw calls, 500,000 triangles, 1.3 GB, 150,000 instances, 50 KB/s down
   (RDC 2024). Phones run CPU work about 4 times slower than a desktop. Studio memory "is incorrect
   in Studio, you need to test live" (McNeill). Studio runs the playtest Server and Client in one
   process, so server work shows in client frames [added, measured].
2. **Name the cause before the fix.** Label every per-frame system with `debug.profilebegin` and fix
   the longest lowest-level label (Roblox Learn, MicroProfiler). Studio's `execute_luau` reaches the
   Script Profiler, so an agent gets the same answer by code: `BasePart.CFrame [C]` and the scan
   label led the lab's server time (measured).
3. **Gate on frame consistency, compared per frame.** Fifty-nine 10 ms frames plus one 410 ms frame
   stutter at "60 fps" (Roblox Learn). Use the lead gate: p95 at most 1.2 times the budget, worst at
   most 2 times; healthy places read p95 17.2 to 17.4 ms at 60 fps. Compare script time per frame:
   per-frame work runs more often once a fix raises the frame rate [added, measured].
4. **Remove server work players never see.** "Never tween on the server" (Crusherfire). Resizing a
   welded server part re-replicates the whole assembly (McNeill and Lynn, RDC 2025). Anchoring idle
   zombies halved one game's server CPU (same talk). Anchoring is not enough when the server still
   moves the parts: anchored coins spun by the server sent 7.6 to 10 MB/s in Studio, and 12 KB/s
   once clients spun them (measured; `DataSendKbps` is in kilobytes per second).
5. **A leak is a rising floor, named by its owner.** Healthy memory is a sawtooth (Roblox Learn).
   Snapshot 3 or 4 times in the same state and trust only rows that keep rising (Crusherfire).
   Server leaks matter most, because a server outlives hundreds of players (Crusherfire). `Destroy`
   does not release a part's connections to other signals: each orb stayed in memory, unparented,
   held by its Heartbeat closure (measured).
6. **Replication is memory, bandwidth and join time.** Tags and attributes on every part replicate
   to every client: one game's crash rate rose from 3 to 4 percent to 45 percent (McNeill and Lynn).
   Each server-owned moving assembly costs about 1 KB/s, and a join replicates about 10,000
   instances per second (McNeill). Keep server-only data in Luau tables and heavy folders in
   ServerStorage; tune streaming instead of turning it off (Roblox Learn).
7. **Release is part of performance, and a person ships.** Handle `ServerRestartScheduled`, restart
   only outdated servers, and investigate a client crash rate above 2 to 3 percent after an update
   (docs). A rollback is restore, publish, restart: restoring alone publishes nothing (docs). Agents
   prepare and dry-run; the owner publishes.

## Establish first

- Symptom and side: low client frame rate, server lag (heartbeat under 60, rubber-banding for
  everyone), crashes or memory, join time, or bandwidth. One owner per symptom.
- Target devices: the lowest phone you support. Default: a 2 GB phone, 60 fps, budgets in
  [critique.md](references/critique.md).
- Live data: Performance dashboard numbers (crash rate, server memory by age, frame rate by device)
  if the game is live.
- Repro: a place or a scripted scenario that shows the problem in a playtest, with a debug spawner
  for load (N players, N NPCs, N items).
- Release state: unreleased, live with players, or mid-update; who may publish and restart (always a
  person).
- Defaults when unanswered: measure the Server and the Client, change one thing per playtest, no
  publish.

## Procedure

1. **Reproduce under load.** Goal: the slow case in a playtest, with numbers on both sides. How: a
   debug spawner driven by Workspace attributes (N players, N NPCs, N items; McNeill and Lynn), then
   `rbx_perf.measure(pt, 6)` on Server and Client at the same server `time()`
   ([P2](references/procedures.md)). GATE: baseline saved for both sides; the side that fails the
   frame gate is named.
2. **Audit statically.** Goal: costly patterns and counts before playtesting. How:
   `rbx_perf.audit_place(path)` in Lune; `PerfAudit.all(game)` in Edit (P1). GATE: every warn fixed
   or justified in one line; counts inside the Numbers table.
3. **Name the cause.** Goal: the function, label or asset that owns the cost. How:
   `rbx_perf.script_profile(s, side)` in the playtest; `MicroProf.capture` for labels in Edit;
   `SceneScan.all()` for triangles, instances and script memory (P3, P6). GATE: the top function or
   label is named with its ms per frame.
4. **Fix one thing per playtest.** Goal: a proven gain, nothing else changed. How: flip one
   attribute, measure at the same offset, `rbx_perf.compare(before, after)` with its 5 percent noise
   floor. Patterns in P4. GATE: the metric the fix touches improves past the noise floor; no other
   metric gets worse; the frame gate holds on the side that hurts.
5. **Soak for leaks.** Goal: memory that never comes down, with its owner. How: `PerfProbe.soak`,
   `HeapProf.diff` and `SceneScan` UnparentedInstances on the Server over 20 s or more, leak path on
   and off (P5). GATE: memory category growth and unparented instances stay flat; tracked objects
   stay bounded.
6. **Check scene, draws and streaming.** Goal: the worst view fits the phone budget. How: Client
   `Stats.SceneDrawcallCount` and `SceneTriangleCount`, the batching probe (P7), streaming radii in
   the project file (P8). GATE: draw calls, triangles and instances inside the Numbers table at the
   worst view.
7. **Hand the phone list to the owner.** Goal: device numbers Studio cannot give. How: the list in
   P9 and the GUI paths in [gui-paths.md](references/gui-paths.md). GATE: memory and frame rate from
   a real phone, or the report says "Studio only".
8. **Release.** Goal: an update players survive, with a way back. How: the restart handler (P10),
   saves from scenario-roblox-data, ShipCheck from scenario-roblox-tooling; the owner publishes and
   restarts outdated servers. GATE: handler tested in a playtest; the owner's go recorded; the agent
   never publishes.

## Numbers

## Quality gates

Measurable:

- Frame gate on the side that hurts, from `PerfProbe.window(...).gate` or the lead `Stats.frames`.
- `rbx_perf.compare` rows past the noise floor for the metric each fix touches, with one result file
  per variant.
- `PerfAudit` 0 warn findings, or each one justified.
- Soak: memory category growth and unparented instances flat; tracked objects bounded.
- `SceneScan` and Client `Stats`: draw calls, triangles and instances inside the Numbers table.
- Every per-frame system carries a `debug.profilebegin` label; long-lived threads set
  `debug.setmemorycategory`.
- Restart handler connected in a playtest; P9 phone numbers reported by the owner or marked "Studio
  only".

Visual: a playtest capture through `rbx_review` of the worst view before and after
(`rbx_review.contact_sheet`), and the MicroProfiler or Script Profiler capture taken by hand when a
claim cites it ([gui-paths.md](references/gui-paths.md)). The full rubric is in
[critique.md](references/critique.md).

## Handoffs

- Receives from scenario-roblox-environment: EnvAudit counts and per-model streaming modes
  (environment owns per-model modes; streaming settings are decided here).
- Receives from scenario-roblox-luau: Bench and Parallel results, native candidates and leak slopes.
- Receives from scenario-roblox-gameplay: NPC bench numbers; from scenario-roblox-vfx-audio:
  emitter, beam and flipbook counts; from scenario-roblox-networking: payload sizes and send rates.
- Delivers to scenario-roblox-luau: the leaking function or hot loop. Cleanup code (`Leak`, class
  template), native code and Actors live there.
- Delivers to scenario-roblox-tooling: the go for a release. ShipCheck, Saved versions, Open Cloud
  publishing and `:restartServers` automation live there; agents run dry runs only.
- Delivers to scenario-roblox-data: the restart plan, so `BindToClose` and session saves fit the 30
  s shutdown budget.
- Delivers to scenario-roblox-ui, scenario-roblox-assets and scenario-roblox-animation: UI draw
  calls, texture or mesh budgets and rig timers (`updateInvalidatedFastClusters`) that failed a
  gate.

## Current Roblox notes

- `ScriptProfilerService` and `HeapProfilerService` are PluginSecurity. Studio's `execute_luau`
  reaches both on the playtest Server and Client; a game Script gets "lacking capability Plugin"
  (measured, [P3](references/procedures.md)).
- `SceneAnalysisService` exposes the Scene Analysis window as six queries. It answered in Edit, on
  the playtest Server and on the Client, and a game Script can call it (measured).
- Draw calls and triangles are script-readable on the Client through `Stats.SceneDrawcallCount` and
  `SceneTriangleCount`. They froze when the Studio window stopped drawing 3D (measured).
- Streaming is on for new places. Its Workspace settings are NotScriptable for game scripts and
  absent from the type definitions. From `execute_luau` only `StreamingEnabled` reads and writes;
  the radii fail with "is not a valid member of Workspace" (measured). Set them in the Properties
  panel or the Rojo project.
- `RunService.PreRender` replaces `RenderStepped`. `Lighting.LightingStyle` replaces `Technology`
  (Future is Realistic plus PrioritizeLightingQuality). 4K textures are live since 2026-01-30.
- Publishing needs the Maturity and Compliance questionnaire, and the place publishing API cannot
  update SurfaceAppearance, unions, EditableImage, EditableMesh or BaseWrap content.
- `require("@rbx/LibMP")` exposes the MicroProfiler to `execute_luau` and the command bar (MCP skill
  `rbx-perf-profiling`). Edit snapshots hold full frames; playtest snapshots held 0 to 128 frames,
  fewer on heavy scenes (measured).
