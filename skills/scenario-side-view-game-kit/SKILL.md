# Scenario Side-View Game Kit

## Overview

A side-scroller needs two families of image assets no single generation gives: pixel sprites that animate cleanly on one feet line, and painted level layers that stack into parallax and repeat without seams. This route comes from a browser side-scroller made in one agent session (one hero, two ground enemies, five levels):

1. **Characters.** A text-to-image still with two poses on flat magenta (hero: rest and jump; enemy: rest and attack wind-up), reframed with headroom, then one 3 second image-to-video clip per cycle, the character running or walking "like a treadmill" in a pure side profile facing right. A local script keys the magenta, cuts a loop or one-shot window, and pixelates every cycle of a character onto one shared canvas and palette. Fall, wall cling, plunge and dash come from one pose sheet. Make one facing; the game mirrors it.
2. **Levels.** Per level, five renders in "richly detailed high-resolution pixel art" (background, midground, wall texture, platform strip, props), made into WebP layers locally.

The finish is local on purpose: keying, the loop search, the shared palette and the seamless cross-fade need pixels on disk, and the deliverables are game files. If the user wants the finished strips on the platform too, `upload_asset` them into a collection.

Connection, scope and the core loop: the `scenario` skill. Frame tools, GIF previews and engine slicing: `scenario-sprite-animation`. Pixel cleanup and other statics: `scenario-game-assets`. Clip model families: `scenario-video`. Music and sound effects are outside this image skill. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

The agent runs the scripts locally (Python 3, Pillow, NumPy; `side_sprites.py` also needs ffmpeg): [reframe_stills.py](scripts/reframe_stills.py) makes the clip first frames, [side_sprites.py](scripts/side_sprites.py) builds the strips and imports [sprite_cycles.py](scripts/sprite_cycles.py) (never run directly), and [process_env.py](scripts/process_env.py) finishes the level layers. Prompts with slots: [references/prompt-templates.md](references/prompt-templates.md). Read [references/processing-settings.md](references/processing-settings.md) before changing a script flag or when `--report` flags a loop.

Payload names below (`startImage`, `endImage`, `referenceImages`, `background`, `quality`, `numOutputs`, `cfgScale`) are the build's schemas' examples: use the fields your pick's `model_schema_get` lists. The image pick needs strong layout adherence, a reference-image input and a transparent-background option; if its schema lacks one, take the next ranked pick.

## Worked example

A user asks: "Make the art for my side-scroller: a fox knight hero with a rapier, a mole miner enemy with a pickaxe, and two levels, a mushroom forest and a crystal mine." Pass `team_id` and `project_id` on every call (the `scenario` skill covers picking them).

1. **Hero still.** `recommend { "capability": "txt2img", "prompt": "<the user's request>; needs reference image input, transparent output" }`, `model_schema_get` the pick, price the [two-pose template](references/prompt-templates.md#1-two-pose-still-text-to-image) (left: standing ready facing right; right: mid-jump facing right) with `model_run { "model_id": "<pick>", "dry_run": true, "parameters": { "prompt": "...", "width": 1536, "height": 1024, "quality": "high", "background": "opaque", "numOutputs": 2 } }`. Tell the user the price, run (`jobs_wait` with its `job_id` if it returns in progress), `asset_display` both takes; keep one with both poses on model and nothing pink or purple, `asset_download` it and `curl -L` it to `fox_two_pose.png`.

2. **First frames.** `python3 scripts/reframe_stills.py fox_two_pose.png --name fox --out frames` writes `frames/fox_rest.png` (left pose, the first frame of every ground clip) and `frames/fox_action.png` (the jump). Check both, then `upload_asset { "file_name": "fox_rest.png", "content_type": "image/png", "kind": "image", "file_size": <bytes> }`, PUT the parts, `upload_asset_complete { "upload_id": "<id>" }`; same for the action frame, which only the air spin uses.

3. **Hero clips.** `recommend { "capability": "img2video", "features": ["endImage"], "prompt": "<the user's request>; square clip, no audio" }`, then `model_schema_get`. One payload per cycle from the [motion templates](references/prompt-templates.md#2-motion-prompts-image-to-video). With the build's schema:

   ```
   run:  { "prompt": "<run sentence> <facing and tail>", "negativePrompt": "<negative>, slowing down, stopping, standing still",
           "startImage": "<fox_rest id>", "duration": "3", "aspectRatio": "1:1", "generateAudio": false }
   atk1: { "prompt": "<attack: a fast rapier thrust ... returns to the starting ready pose> <facing and tail>", "negativePrompt": "<negative>",
           "startImage": "<fox_rest id>", "endImage": "<fox_rest id>", "duration": "3", "aspectRatio": "1:1", "generateAudio": false }
   ```

   Idle and hurt pin like the attack; the air spin uses the action id as both frames. Price each distinct payload with `dry_run: true` (first frame only, pinned, changed guidance), give the user the total, launch every clip with `"wait": false`, and collect them with one `jobs_wait { "job_ids": [...] }`, re-called with the returned `pending_job_ids` as `job_ids` while any is in progress (never poll `job_get`). `asset_display` each; re-run only one that turns toward the camera or travels. `asset_download` each (omit `format` on video) and save as `clips/fox_<cycle>.mp4`, `<cycle>` being exactly the step 5 `--cycles` name (`run`, `idle`, `atk1`, `spin`, `hurt`).

4. **Pose sheet.** Text to image with `referenceImages: ["<chosen still id>"]` and the [pose-sheet template](references/prompt-templates.md#3-static-pose-sheet) (fall, wall cling, plunge, dash). Price, tell the user, run, download as `fox_poses.png`.

5. **Strips.**

   ```
   python3 scripts/side_sprites.py --clips clips --name fox --cycles run:loop:8,idle:loop:8,atk1:attack:7,spin:attack:8,hurt:attack:5 --report
   python3 scripts/side_sprites.py --clips clips --name fox --height 56 --palette 28 \
       --cycles run:loop:8,idle:loop:8,atk1:attack:7,spin:attack:8,hurt:attack:5 \
       --poses fox_poses.png --jump frames/fox_action.png --webp --out sprites
   ```

   View the strips at 4x, nearest-neighbor. If the slash trail keyed into a white block, re-run with `--drop atk1=<index>` (0-based) and `--force`.

6. **Enemy.** Same route: two-pose still (rest, and an attack wind-up that keeps the design consistent), reframe, upload only `mole_rest.png`; walk with the first frame only, the [armed-enemy walk wording](references/prompt-templates.md#armed-enemy-walk) and a lower guidance such as `cfgScale: 0.7` if the schema has one; attack and hurt pinned. `side_sprites.py --clips clips --name mole --height 72 --cycles walk:loop:8,attack:attack:8,hurt:attack:5 --report`; a walk flagged as a weak loop gets `--range walk=12:48` before any re-run.

7. **Level layers.** Fill the five [environment templates](references/prompt-templates.md#4-environment-layer-set) for the mushroom forest (opaque background and texture, the rest transparent). `dry_run` each distinct setting, tell the user the total, run, download as `env/bg1.png`, `env/mid1.png`, `env/tex1.png`, `env/ledge1.png`, `env/props1.png`, then `python3 scripts/process_env.py --env env --out assets --levels 1`. Put level 1 in the game with the fox on it before generating the crystal mine; process that one alone with `--levels 2,` (a bare `2` is a count and redoes level 1), `--force` after a re-render.

8. **Check.** Play each strip at its fps from `<name>_meta.json`, tile the texture across a wall, and draw a long and a short platform.

## Common mistakes

- **An end frame on run or walk.** Pinning the still at both ends of short locomotion spends the clip speeding up and slowing down. First frame only for run and walk; pin first = last for idle and every one-shot so they return to rest.
- **An armed enemy's walk using its weapon.** The build's first armed walk swung its weapon mid-stride and closed at 1.44x baseline. "His arms stay still ... never lifts, swings or twirls it", the weapon terms in the negative and a guidance of 0.7 closed it at 0.42x.
- **Keeping a frame where an effect keyed into a block.** A white slash trail and an impact dust cloud came out of the key as solid blobs; `--drop` removes the sampled frame without changing the shared canvas or palette.
- **Paying to regenerate every weak loop.** A heavy walk closed at 1.03x, a wider range found the same window, and it shipped after review. Widen the range, look at the loop, and pay only when it visibly hitches.
- **Splitting a pose sheet by columns.** Poses overlap horizontally; split by connected components (`--poses` does) and ask for wide gaps.
- **Trusting "seamless tileable" in a texture prompt.** The renders do not tile reliably; `process_env.py` cross-fades opposite edges instead of a re-render.
- **Stretching a platform strip.** Draw left cap + repeated middle + right cap so every length keeps the carved ends.
- **Retro-scale level art.** Small retro paintings failed the first playtest; 1920x1152 detailed layers drawn at 2x replaced them while sprites kept nearest-neighbor scaling. Validate level 1 in the game before the rest.
- **Pink or purple on a character.** Everything strongly magenta is keyed away; say "no pink, no purple, no magenta anywhere on the character" and reject takes that show any.
- **Lossy sprite strips.** Lossy WebP shifts the shared palette; only the HD layers ship lossy.
