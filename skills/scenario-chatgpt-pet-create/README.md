# scenario-chatgpt-pet-create: maintainer notes

Not read at runtime. How the skill was built and why it makes its choices.

## What it targets

OpenAI's Pets page (learn.chatgpt.com/docs/pets) documents the web upload: a transparent PNG or WebP, exactly 1536x1872, at most 20 MiB, under Settings > Personalization > Pet, and says pets made in Codex desktop stay on that computer. The 8 by 9 grid of 192x208 cells and the 11-row v2 layout were read off sheets ChatGPT produced; the Codex folder (`pet.json` plus the sheet under `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/pets/<id>/`) was confirmed by installing a v2 pet in Codex desktop. The 11-row v2 layout (1536x2288, rows 9 and 10 holding sixteen look directions) is the default here because Codex desktop loads it (verified with a real v2 pet) and rows 0-8 of a v2 sheet are exactly a v1 sheet, so the package always carries both: the v1 file costs one crop.

## Why the work is split this way

- **Generation on MCP, geometry local.** Every image comes from `model_run`; cutting, assembly, validation, GIFs and packaging run in the shipped scripts because the deliverable is a file for ChatGPT or Codex and no MCP tool assembles a pet sheet. The sheet and GIFs are uploaded into the pet's collection so the team can reach them.
- **One row per generation.** Image models do not draw an 8x11 grid to the pixel. Each row is one strip; `pet_frames.py extract` finds the poses by connected shapes (never by equal slots) and `pet_build.py` places them.
- **One pet height across rows.** Separate generations draw the pet at different sizes. The build scales every row so the pet's height matches idle, using the frame the prompts keep in the idle stance (last for `jumping`, first for `failed`, the median elsewhere), keeps each frame's lift above its row's ground (a jump stays a jump), and pins the planted lower body (the bottom 28% centroid) to one x. `pet_check.py` measures the same quantities, so what the build aims for is what the check enforces.
- **Edge cleanup once, on rebuilt cells only.** A hard key cut leaves key-tinted edges; one edge-local pass recolors them from solid neighbors. Kept cells of an update are never touched, which is what lets `--base-sheet` promise byte-identical rows.
- **No layout guide images, no labeled sheets as references.** A drawn template passed as a reference image did not hold sprite alignment in `scenario-sprite-animation`'s runs, and anything with labels, outlines or a grid invites the model to copy them. The prompts carry the frame count and spacing; the references are the clean base on its key, earlier strips, and the approved cardinals.
- **Direction verdicts are written by the agent.** Whether a pose looks up or right is a visual judgment; `pet_check.py` only enforces that sixteen verdicts with evidence exist and that the cardinals pass.

## Model ids

The body names `model_openai-gpt-image-2-5-sunburst` and `model_google-gemini-nano-banana-2-1`, and falls back to `recommend` only when both are blocked for the team. This is a deliberate exception to the repository rule against naming generative models, decided for this skill: both keep one character across a row of eight poses from a reference image, and a pet run is 13 generations where a weaker pick shows up as identity drift between rows. When a newer generation of either family ships, update the ids in `pet_prepare.py` (`SUNBURST`, `NANO_BANANA`), both SKILL.md bodies (the create Quick reference and the update Overview) and this file. `model_pixel-snapper` is named as Scenario's tool for the pixel-perfect mode.

## Probes (October 2026)

- Sunburst, one eight-pose run cycle from a single identity reference, asked for `width` 3584 and `height` 512 (7:1): it returned 3584x1200, about 3:1, with eight separated poses on a flat background, all faces screen-right; extraction passed with no errors. `dry_run` quoted 14.75 CU and the job billed 13 CU. `pet_prepare.py` now asks for a height of at least a third of the width.
- Pixel Snapper (`colors` 32) on a 435x640 identity image returned 78x115 with 32 colors; keyed, the pet was 55x93 and `pet_prepare.py pixel` chose a 2 px grid. `dry_run` quoted 6.75 CU, billed 5 CU.
- The generated strip, extracted and rebuilt into an existing v2 sheet with `--base-sheet`, changed only that row; `pet_check.py` measured the new row at 1.003 of the idle height.

## Pixel-perfect mode

Snapping every frame costs one call per frame (73 on v2) and lands frames on different grids, so the pet changes size between frames. The mode snaps only the approved base: its grid and palette become `pixel.json`, the enlarged snapped base becomes every row's reference, and the build puts each placed frame on the sheet's grid (best sub-grid offset, block average, nearest palette color, on/off alpha). Grid 1 covers pixel art drawn at cell resolution: palette and on/off alpha without block enlargement.

## Scripts

Python 3 with Pillow and NumPy, no other dependency (connected components are labeled by row runs rather than with SciPy). `tests/scenario-chatgpt-pet-create/` builds synthetic pets and covers key choice, the job graph and request sizes, extraction order and errors, equal height across rows, the shared ground line, jump lift, mirroring, byte-identical kept rows, pixel mode, the edge cleanup, every structural and quality check, GIF timing and backgrounds, the v1 cut and the install backup.

A real v2 sheet made with ChatGPT (not committed) passed `split`, the full `pet_check.py` (every row within 2.4% of idle height, jump lift 41 px, look-row drift 0.7 px), the previews, `--clean` (byte-identical output), `--reregister jumping` and a rename through `pet_package.py make`.
