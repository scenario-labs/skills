# Objects: uncover, plate, cut-out, 3D, sound

## Uncover rules

Describe the photo literally before choosing anything: walls, floor, furniture, light, what is outside the windows. Then list objects with:

- `name`, a precise visual `description`, `materials`, `support` (floor, table, sofa, shelf), a normalized `bbox` [x0, y0, x1, y1], a size estimate in meters, and notes on occlusion.
- Only single movable items: lamps, cushions, bowls, vases, lanterns, side tables, chairs. Never sofas, rugs, curtains, built-ins, or anything fixed to a wall.
- Prefer objects that are unoccluded, made of one or two materials, with a clear silhouette. Skip plants, glass, and objects holding other objects unless you remove those too.

Keep the list as JSON next to the photo: the box and size estimate drive the scale and placement steps in calibration.

## Plate prompt

Removal only, every object with its position, nothing else asked:

> remove the following from the image: the {object} on the {support}, {where}; the {object} {where}; ...

Check for over-removal (neighboring cushions, decorative screens) and for recoloring instead of removal. When a run fails either way, ask for two outputs if the schema allows it and keep the one that is right, or narrow the list.

## Cut-out prompt

On the original photo, square output at about 1K:

> Isolate the {object} from this image: {its description and where it stands}. Reproduce it exactly as shown -- same colors, materials, and proportions. White background, centered, tight crop, studio lighting. No other objects, no scene, no people, no text, no shadows on the ground. Isolate the object and remove all clustered, adjacent, overlapping, or items resting on the target object{, including ...}. Create a clean render of that one single object that is true to the source image.

Naming what rests on the object ("including the brass lantern standing on its top") keeps it out of the cut-out.

## 3D

Image-to-3D with textures and PBR, a moderate face count (about 50,000 is plenty for a prop seen from a few meters). Then for the web: simplify to about 15,000 to 20,000 triangles (keep more for fretwork), 1,024 px WebP textures, Meshopt geometry (glTF Transform does all three): tens of megabytes become a few hundred kilobytes. Set metalness to zero on anything that is not real metal.

## Sound

One clip per object holding several separate impacts:

> Four separate one-shot impacts, each followed by a full second of silence: {object and material} {knocked over / dropped} onto {floor}, {character}. Close-miked, dry room, no music, no voices.

Split it on silence (for example ffmpeg `silencedetect` at -38 dB with gaps of 0.2 s), keep two to four hits, add a short fade-out, and normalize loudness. In the viewer, play one at random on impact, never the same twice in a row, panned toward where it landed.
