# Placement specs

Authoring-time values (2026). Platform UI and store requirements churn: treat every row as the default, confirm contractual deliverables against the platform's current published spec, and read safe zones as approximate. The workflow around these numbers is SKILL.md's ladder and order of operations: aim generative work at the row's ratio, land exact pixels with a resize, then verify by measurement.

## The 9:16 safe zone

Platform UI eats the edges of stories, reels, and TikTok. Keep the subject, all text, and any mark inside the central band: clear roughly the top 14 percent, the bottom 35 percent, and 6 to 13 percent per side (as of 2026, the same band `scenario-video-ads` composes video masters to). One composition inside that band passes every 9:16 placement.

Marketplace main images are policy surfaces, not creative ones: Amazon wants the product on pure white (RGB 255, 255, 255) filling about 85 percent of the frame with no text, logos, or watermarks, and the other marketplaces run close variants. The text-free master doctrine pays off here: the master is the main image, and lettered or lifestyle derivatives fill the secondary slots and social placements.

## Print

| ---------------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| A4                     | 210x297 mm | 2480x3508         |       |
| A3                     | 297x420 mm | 3508x4961         |       |

| Movie one-sheet poster | 27x40 in   | 8100x12000        |       |

Add 3 mm of bleed per edge (0.125 in on US trims) and keep text 5 mm inside the trim. 300 dpi targets exceed native generation sizes: generate the master at the largest clean size, upscale to the print target (`search` query `"upscale"`), and only then letter.
