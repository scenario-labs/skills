# Scenario

## Overview

Scenario generates images, video, 3D, and audio across 500+ models, plus custom training.

## Setup

- Endpoint: `https://mcp.scenario.com/mcp` (Streamable HTTP). Prefer OAuth: no credentials pass
  through the conversation.
- Client config, headless API-key setup, and per-client re-authentication:
  [references/setup.md](references/setup.md).
- Never ask an agent to collect, encode, or echo a secret.
- A previously authenticated connection now failing: re-authenticate before debugging.
  `diagnostics_run` names the layer (`auth`, `tenant-scope`, `api-unreachable`, or `healthy`).

Two tool kinds:

- **Direct**: the loop below, plus `asset_get`, `job_get`, `jobs_list`, and `models_list`.
  `?toolsets=full` exposes everything.
- **Catalog**: the rest (collections, tagging, analysis, training, members, keys).
  - `scenario_tools_search` takes only `query` (tool name or keywords) and `limit`; returns schema
    and lane.
  - `scenario_tool_execute_read` / `write` / `delete` runs the tool with `{name, parameters}`.
  - Every input goes inside `parameters`, scope ids and `dry_run` included. Nearly every catalog
    tool declares scope ids; `plan_generation` takes only `description`.
  - Direct tools take scope, and `model_run` its `dry_run`, at top level.
  - The executor drops a misplaced key silently: `arguments` surfaces as a false scope error, and a
    top-level `dry_run` runs the job, billed.
  - The lane is the result's own `permission`, not the verb: `asset_download` and `asset_analyze`
    are write-class.

## Scope first

- Resolve scope first, then pass `team_id` and `project_id` on every call.
- `teams_list` returns the teams with their projects. `projects_list` needs a `team_id`, so it
  cannot come first.
- Confirm the pair with the user: a guess writes into someone else's project. Unattended, take the
  pair from the task; if it names none, stop and list the choices.
- The server fills scope only for read-only tools with one candidate. Otherwise it fails, naming the
  wrong half.
- Scope omissions commonly fail when a second team or project becomes available.

- **Multi-step request** ("product video with voiceover", "concept to 3D"): catalog
  `plan_generation` (read lane). Plain words in `description`, ordered steps out, each naming a tool
  and an optional model hint. It runs nothing. A single step goes to `recommend`.
- **Stated preference** ("always 9:16"): catalog `memory_set` (delete lane), `scope`
  `project_user_memory` (`user_memory` across projects). It replaces the whole layer: `memory_get`
  and merge first.

## Worked example

Generating a stylized game prop image:

1. Discover the model:
   - `recommend` with the user's own words as `prompt` for a capability.
   - `search` with `target="models"`, `query="<model name>"`, `public=true` for a known name. It
     ranks by keyword and its `filters` hold no capability key, so a capability-worded query can
     rank the wrong output type first.
   - The user's own trained models: omit `public` on `search` (it has no private flag); pass
     `include_private_models: true` on `recommend`.
   - Re-discover ids each time: availability differs per team.
2. `model_schema_get` on the pick: exact field names, types, required flags, defaults, and caps.
   - Overrunning a cap such as the prompt's `max_length` is a 400, never a trim.
   - File fields take asset ids, even when named `...Url`.
   - `cost_impact: true` flags the fields that move the price.
3. If the schema carries `runs_as` (`"lora"` or `"composition"`), never send that model's id to
   `model_run`. Its `run_with.required_arguments` holds the real call: `model_id` there is the base
   model, and its `parameters` (the `loras` or `modelId` wiring) merge with your inputs from the
   same schema. `required_arguments` alone discards your prompt.
4. Optional: `prompt_spark` rewrites a thin prompt into an on-model one. Pass the discovered id (a
   LoRA's own, not its base) and the draft `prompt`. Skip deliberate prompts.
5. `model_run` with `model_id` and schema-conformant `parameters`.
   - Unless the user says cost does not matter, price first with `dry_run: true`, top level beside
     `model_id`. No job is created, and `creativeUnitsCost` is this exact payload's price.
   - A `recommend` quote assumes defaults; `cost_impact` fields move the real number.
   - Run: inline assets (`status: success`) need no wait; otherwise pass `job_id` to `jobs_wait`.
   - Unfinished status: `in_progress` after a timed-out wait; with `wait=false`, `queued`,
     `in-progress`, or `warming-up`. All need `jobs_wait`.
6. `jobs_wait` with `job_ids=[...]` (up to 32).
   - Each completed row carries `assetIds` and `cuCost`: no `job_get` follow-up.
   - On timeout (`in_progress`), re-call with `pending_job_ids` as `job_ids`; never re-run or
     cancel. No timeout argument exists.
   - Failed jobs are reimbursed, except xAI generations stopped by moderation.
7. `asset_display` shows the asset inline. Its `format` picks the rendering:
   - `display` (default): inline image, links, viewer data; does not disable the host widget.
   - `viewer`: lighter payload for hosts rendering the interactive widget.
   - `json`, `markdown`: metadata and links.
8. `asset_download` returns a file URL, one call per asset; save it with `curl -L` (it may
   redirect).
   - `format` converts images (`png`, `webp`, `jpg`; `gif` keeps an animated GIF animated, while the
     `png` default flattens it to one frame) and meshes (`glb`, `fbx`, `obj`). Omit it for video and
     audio, or it fails with 400 `Invalid target format`.
   - `curl` failing with `host_not_allowed` or `CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403` while MCP calls
     work points at the host's egress policy. A CDN 403 alone does not: fetch a fresh URL first.
   - [Sandbox network access](https://mcp.scenario.com/docs/troubleshooting#sandbox-network-access)
     names the setting. On some hosts it is an organization allowlist the user may not control.
   - Meanwhile hand over `asset_display`'s `app_url`. The user downloads there and, for a mesh,
     picks an export format `asset_download` does not offer.
   - The signed URL expires: a last resort, never the deliverable.

Local inputs go up with `upload_asset`:

- Always `file_name`, `content_type`, and `kind` (`image`, `audio`, `video`, `3d`), plus exactly one
  of `file_size` or `data`. Without either it fails with
  `Either 'file_size' … or 'data' is required`.
- Prefer `file_size`, the exact byte count read from disk, and omit `data`. The reply carries
  presigned part URLs and `instructions`.
- PUT each part's raw bytes to its URL with no added headers: a checksum header makes the store
  answer 403. Check every PUT returned 200, then `upload_asset_complete` with the `upload_id`.
- Inline base64 `data` only under 100KB, and only when no shell can PUT parts. It returns the asset
  directly, with no complete step; a larger file is rejected, naming the cap.
- Both calls take scope and nothing else: no parts list, no etags.
- Inline `data` is decoded inside `upload_asset`: a decode error there (`libpng read error`,
  `Corrupt JPEG data`, `unable to read pixels`) means the base64 string broke, not the file.
  - The agent retypes every character of `data`; a 57K-character string broke that way.
  - Re-sending it repeats the error. With a shell, switch to the `file_size` path, even when the
    user asked for inline, and say why.
- On the `file_size` path the server decodes at completion: `Upload upl_… failed:` with
  `Corrupt JPEG data`, `premature end of data segment`, `bad Huffman code`, or `libpng read error`
  means it could not.
  - Check for a corrupt source, a truncated or re-encoded body, a missing part, or a wrong
    `file_size`.
  - Confirm the local file opens under its declared content type, then start over with a fresh
    `upload_asset` and raw PUTs. Never re-complete the same `upload_id`.
- A phone's HEIC photo uploads as is (`content_type: "image/heic"`): do not convert it.
  `Unhandled image format` lists what `kind: "image"` accepts; convert any other type locally.
- A host with no shell cannot PUT parts. The user uploads at app.scenario.com and the agent
  continues from the asset id.

Filing is part of delivering, not a tidy-up:

- `collection_create` takes a name and the scope pair only. `asset_ids` sent there is silently
  ignored, so adding is always a second call: `collection_add_assets` with `collection_id` and
  `asset_ids`.
- It accepts any number of ids, batches by 49, and skips duplicates. Results separate
  `already_present_asset_ids` from `added_asset_ids`.
- After failure, safely resend the whole list: the error counts additions; retries add the rest.
- Confirm from that reply: `search` `filters={"collection_ids": [...]}` lags on a fresh write.
- `asset_add_tags` is additive, one `asset_id` per call. A tag the asset already carries returns 400
  `Duplicated tag`: read `tags` via `assets_get_bulk` first and send only the missing ones.

Reusable templates and reference content follow the
[shared asset lifecycle](references/shared-assets.md): resolve existing assets, stage new versions,
publish only through a supported operation, and verify public access before recording public ids.
Uploading and filing alone are not publication.

## Errors and recovery

- **`context_missing`**: nothing resolved. `teams_list`, `projects_list` if necessary.
- **`context_ambiguous`**: several fit. Present the options; the user picks (unattended: the task
  names the pair, else stop and list).
- **403 Forbidden**: usually wrong scope, not missing; re-check the id pair. A private asset input
  reads only from its own project:
  - ask which project holds it (unattended: the task names it, else stop);
  - run catalog `asset_copy` (write lane) with that project as `project_id`, plus `asset_id` and
    `target_project_id`;
  - use the returned id. `asset_copy` copies only between projects of one team.
- **403 naming a plan**: surface the upgrade or switch models; a retry never clears it. `recommend`
  pre-flags these as `requires_plan_upgrade` (never run one) unless its response says plan gating is
  `_degraded`; then this entry is the backstop.
- **429 with `details.actionName` = `parallel-custom-jobs`**: the per-team generation concurrency
  ceiling. Keep at most `actionLimit` jobs in flight: launch with `wait=false`, and retire jobs with
  `jobs_wait` before launching more. An immediate retry repeats the error.
- **429 `custom-generation`, or naming a quota, balance, or seat limit**:
  - `actionLimit` is the period's CU allowance (Free: 50 a day), `actionValue` what is already
    consumed. A run priced above the gap is refused, so a low `actionValue` means this payload costs
    too much, not that credits ran out.
  - Stop the batch, `dry_run` the payload, offer a cheaper member or fewer outputs, or report the
    reset or upgrade (unattended: report and stop).
  - `usage` takes the same `project_id` (or `scope: "team"`).
  - A per-user cap goes to the team admin; a seat-cap error can also block uploads. Never change
    billing or membership yourself.
- **429 `Too Many Requests. Please, wait N seconds` (`remainingSeconds`)**: Relax mode: the plan's
  CU are spent, so every job brings a wait.
  - The wait scales with the payload's cost: a heavy job (high effort tier, long video) can stay
    locked while a cheaper one runs. Never re-submit the same payload inside `remainingSeconds`.
  - Any team member's job restarts the team's wait, and waits lengthen as the team keeps generating,
    so a batch slows down. A refused attempt is free.
  - Detect Relax mode from this refusal: `usage` reports consumption, not remaining CU. If no tool
    documents how to check the wait, say it is unknown.
  - Stop the batch. Offer a CU top-up (it ends Relax mode at once) or an upgrade; else a cheaper
    payload (`dry_run` it first), fewer outputs, or a later run (unattended: report and stop, never
    relaunch).
  - Rules and plan caps:
    [Relax Mode](https://help.scenario.com/articles/2332232342-relax-mode-keep-generating-after-your-compute-units-run-out).
- **Other 429, including an unfamiliar `actionName`**: never infer its behavior from the name.
  Report it and run `diagnostics_run` in the same scope before choosing a recovery.
- **Transport error on `model_run` (no HTTP status)**: the request may still have landed. Run
  `jobs_list` before any re-run, or a lost response becomes a double charge. A `dry_run` creates no
  job and always retries safely.
- **400 `Cannot cancel this type of job`**: a launched job is committed spend. `job_cancel` rejects
  most generation jobs, so plan batches with no abort path.
- **404 on `asset_get`**: the id does not exist, and no retry makes it appear. Re-read `assetIds`
  off the `jobs_wait` or `job_get` row: a guessed or mistyped id is the usual cause.
- **400 `At least one of query, filter, image, or images must be provided`**: `search` never lists
  bare. A newest-first asset listing is `target="assets"`, `filter="createdAt EXISTS"`,
  `sort_by=["createdAt:desc"]`.
- **`recommend` client-side timeout**: it ranks on live data and commonly runs 30 seconds, sometimes
  over a minute. Wait or re-call it; never fall back to `search` for a capability.

## Common mistakes

- Pricing a later step with a placeholder id (`asset_placeholder`): file ids resolve before pricing,
  so the `dry_run` returns 404 and quotes nothing. Quote it from `recommend`, then `dry_run` once
  the real asset exists.
- A bare value where the schema says `array: true`: silently dropped, so the run ignores your
  reference or LoRA. `asset_get` on the output echoes what the run consumed
  (`metadata.referenceImages`, `parentId`): the cheapest proof.
- Taking `recommend`'s `ranked[0]` blindly. Read `next_step.type` first:
  - `no_match`: stop generation, even with ranked partial options. Explain `unmet_requirements` and
    `suggested_action`; never silently relax requirements. Schema checks or a successful dry run do
    not override `no_match`.
  - `ask_user`: present the options; the user's pick wins (unattended: the task, else `proceed`).
  - `proceed`: prefer `specialty.model_id`, else the first `ranked` entry not marked deprecated in
    its `caveats`, `tradeoff`, or `explanation`. The ranking measures performance, not lifecycle.
- Debugging blind: the `diagnose` MCP prompt returns trace ids, as does `diagnostics_run` with the
  failing call's scope pair and any `mcpt_` ids seen as `observed_trace_ids`.
- Guessing a file field's name: 400 `Input image is required` (or `referenceImages`, `startImage`,
  `frontImage`, `video`: each model names its own) means the payload lacks the schema's `required`
  field. Copy its name verbatim. A URL there reads as missing: file fields take asset ids only.
- Feeding an image field a video, audio, or 3D asset: 400 `Unhandled image format` lists the
  accepted types. `asset_get` reports the asset's `mimeType`; pull a still with the clip's
  `firstFrame` when the model wants an image.
- `filters.kind` on `search` with `target="models"`: a 400 `"kind" is not a filterable field`, since
  `kind` describes assets. Narrow models by `filters.type` (architecture) or `tags`, or `recommend`
  a capability.
- Filtering `models_list` by `type` without `privacy: "public"`: a 400 says so. A private listing
  narrows by `status` or `modality`, or goes through `search` (private by default).
