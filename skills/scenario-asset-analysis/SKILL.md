# Scenario Asset Analysis

## Overview

Four tools extract captions, style descriptions, analysis, or control maps from existing assets:
three fixed-purpose, one open-ended. With `search` (default toolset) they answer the questions that
come after a batch lands, which is where most of the work actually is: is this on brief, what look
is this, what does this show, what can the next model condition on, where did last week's approved
version go.

None of them are in the default toolset. Get schemas with `scenario_tools_search`, then run each
through the executor matching the returned `permission`: `read` uses `scenario_tool_execute_read`,
`write` uses `scenario_tool_execute_write`. Use that live result for both estimates and runs; do not
infer the lane from an unchanged input asset. Put the tool name in `name` and its inputs under
`parameters`. Or reconnect with `?toolsets=full`. Connection and scope: see the `scenario` skill in
this repo. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to
install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool
schemas and flag the gap.

## Quick reference

| Need                                 | Tool             | Shape                                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A caption for one image              | `asset_caption`  | `details_level`: `action` or `action+style`                       |
| A reusable look off one image        | `asset_describe` | Returns a full description plus a promptable synthesis            |
| Anything else, in your own words     | `asset_analyze`  | `instruction` plus up to 10 `images` and 10 `text_inputs`         |
| A conditioning map for another model | `asset_detect`   | `modality`, one of ten including canny, depth, pose, segmentation |

All four bill credits and all four take `dry_run: true` inside `parameters` for an estimate first.
For OAuth, pass the user-selected `team_id` and `project_id` on estimates and runs. A repeated run
can create another billed job; an executor lane does not make it free.

## The four facts that change the plan

- **`asset_analyze` batches.** One call carries up to 10 images against one `instruction`, so
  reviewing 200 assets is 20 calls, not 200. `num_outputs` (1 to 5) is unrelated: it returns several
  distinct answers to the same instruction, not one answer per image. Ask for a fixed per-image
  output shape in the `instruction` so the answers stay parseable.
- **`asset_detect` strips the background by default.** `remove_background` defaults to true, so a
  depth or pose map comes back with the frame's context already gone. Set it false whenever the map
  has to cover the whole image.
- **It reads a render, not the file.** On a vector or layered source it cannot confirm what the file
  is or report its exact values: one call called a 16-path SVG raster, shifted a `#101614` fill to
  `#131A18`, and missed an off-palette path. Parse the file for exact color and structure; the tool
  judges what the render shows.
- **Fixed beats flexible when it fits.** `asset_caption` and `asset_describe` are purpose-built and
  faster than instructing an LLM to do the same job. Reach for `asset_analyze` for classification,
  extraction, comparison, translation, or a verdict against a brief. One carve-out: for a structured
  pass/warn/fail verdict against a configured brand brief, teams with the Quality Gate add-on have a
  dedicated tool that stores its verdict and re-reads it free (see `scenario-quality-gate`);
  `asset_analyze` stays the route when the add-on is missing or the brief exists only as prose.

`asset_analyze` and `asset_detect` wait up to 180s and then hand back a `job_id`; carry on with
`jobs_wait` as anywhere else.

## Finding an asset again

Retrieval is `search` with `target="assets"`, and at least one of `query`, `filters`, `filter`,
`image`, or `images` must be set: an empty call is a 400, not an everything-list.

- **By text.** `query` is keyword matching by default; `query_semantic_ratio` moves it toward
  meaning (0.5 to 0.8 suits mood queries like "dark medieval atmosphere", 1 is pure semantic).
  `sort_by` (say `["createdAt:desc"]`) is ignored while that ratio is above 0, so a newest-first
  list needs keyword mode.
- **By similarity.** `image` takes one asset id or image URL and returns lookalikes; `images` takes
  `{"like": [...], "unlike": [...]}` to steer with positive and negative examples (the two fields
  are mutually exclusive). `image_semantic_ratio` decides what similar means: 1, the default,
  matches subject and mood; 0 matches image features, the setting for hunting near-duplicates and
  crops. Add a `query` beside it for "like these, but more stylized".
- **By structure.** `filters` narrows on `kind`, `tags`, `model_id`, `collection_ids`, and
  `created_after`/`created_before`, ANDed with everything above.

## Worked example: reviewing a batch against a brief

1. Collect the asset ids from the run (`jobs_wait` returns them).
2. `asset_analyze` with `dry_run: true` on the first chunk to price the pass.
3. `asset_analyze` with `images` set to 10 ids and an `instruction` that states the brief and fixes
   the output: "For each image in order, reply `<index>: pass|fail, <reason in under 12 words>`, a
   reason on every line, passes included. Fail anything not centered, not on a plain field, or
   carrying text." Repeat per chunk. Answers land as text assets (one, or one per image):
   `asset_download` them to read the verdicts.
4. `asset_describe` on the strongest pass. Its promptable synthesis goes straight into the next
   batch's prompt, which holds the look without a training run (see `scenario-consistency`); when
   the synthesis is only a short title, prompt with the description instead.
5. File the result: `collection_create`, then one `collection_add_assets` call with every id (it
   batches past 49 itself and skips ids already filed). `asset_add_tags` is additive, so tag the
   failures rather than rebuilding a tag set. The set comes back later with `search`
   `filters={"collection_ids": [...]}`, and its lookalikes with `images={"like": [...]}`.

## Common mistakes

- One `asset_analyze` call per asset when 10 fit in a call.
- Treating `num_outputs` as a batch size over `images`.
- Leaving `remove_background` at its default on an `asset_detect` map that must match the source
  frame.
- Reusing a remembered executor lane: use the `permission` from fresh `scenario_tools_search`
  results, including for `dry_run`. A lane rejection means refresh discovery and use its executor,
  not retry the same call.
- Asking `asset_analyze` to produce an image. It returns text; control maps come from `asset_detect`
  and final renders from `model_run`.
