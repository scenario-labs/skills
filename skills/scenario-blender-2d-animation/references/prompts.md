# Prompt patterns

Ten generations make one look: a concept frame, eight pictures that take the concept as their reference image, and
a run clip whose first frame is the hero's reframed rest pose, never the concept. The patterns below are the ones that worked for the three looks of the reference shot (a red panda in a
golden-hour jungle, a black cat on a moonlit Halloween street, a snow leopard cub in a white winter valley).
Replace the bracketed parts; keep the structure and the "no ..." lists, they carry most of the work.

## 1. Concept frame (text to image, opaque, 16:9, two takes)

The one picture that locks the look. Write it as a screenshot of the finished game, not as an illustration.

> In-game screenshot of a premium polished 2D side-scrolling mobile platformer, the art quality and finish of a
> top-grossing casual mobile game: bold clean cartoon shapes, glossy soft painterly shading, thick dark outlines on
> characters and props, [palette and light].
>
> Scene, strictly side view, layered for parallax: [sky]; [far layer, e.g. a calm sea with distant islands on the
> horizon]; [mid layer, e.g. jungle hills with ruins]; a ground strip of [material] with a clear flat walkable top
> edge running across the lower quarter; [foreground plants] in the foreground corners.
>
> Gameplay elements: [hero: species, size, two or three memorable details, a small accessory], running to the
> right; a floating [platform] with three [coins] above it; [a tree that will drop things]; on the right, a small
> tower stacked from [props that belong to this world].
>
> No text, no UI, no logo, no HUD.

Name the layers in the order the scene will stack them. "Strictly side view" and "flat walkable top edge" are what
make the frame usable as a game camera. Name the props you want, and say which materials you do not want if a
generic tower would read as some other game.

## 2. Layers (image edit with the concept as reference, one layer per call)

Every layer prompt starts the same way and differs only in what it keeps:

> [Role] layer for a 2D side-scrolling mobile platformer, in exactly the same art style, colors and [light] as the
> reference screenshot, on a fully transparent background. [What is in it, spread across the whole width].
> [Where it sits in the image]. Everything above [its top] is completely transparent: no [the layers behind it].
> No [the layers in front of it], no characters, no text. Wide panoramic layer, strictly side view.

| Role       | Background  | Size (px)   | What makes it work                                                                                                      |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sky        | opaque      | 2560 x 1440 | "ONLY THE SKY"; no land, sea or trees; the sun placed where the light comes from                                        |
| Far layer  | transparent | 3072 x 1152 | the horizon line "at about the middle of the image"; content "continues down to the bottom edge"                        |
| Mid layer  | transparent | 3072 x 1152 | "fills the bottom 55% solidly from edge to edge"; "slightly hazy and softer" to read as far                             |
| Ground     | transparent | 2048 x 768  | "a perfectly flat, level walkable top edge ... at about 30% from the top"; "no rounded end caps, so it can be repeated" |
| Foreground | transparent | 3072 x 1024 | five numbered clusters "each standing on its own base, with wide empty transparent gaps"                                |

Wide layers are tiled later ([prep_assets.py](../scripts/prep_assets.py) `tile`), so ask for content "spread across
the whole width" and keep any single landmark (a big arch, a castle) away from the ends.

## 3. Props sheet and the tree (image edit, transparent)

> Game props sprite sheet for a 2D side-scrolling mobile physics platformer set in [world], in exactly the same art
> style, colors and lighting as the reference screenshot, on a fully transparent background. Every prop is drawn
> flat, strictly side view with no perspective and no shadow, each one separate with wide empty transparent gaps
> between them so they can be cut apart, arranged in a loose grid: 1) [pot]; 2) [tall vessel]; 3) [short jar with a
> flat lid]; 4) [small heavy statue]; 5) [round fruit that will fall]; 6) [coin with an emblem], seen face on; 7) a
> floating chunk of [island], flat walkable top, about three times wider than tall; 8) a flat [pedestal], wide and
> short. No characters, no ground, no text.

The numbered order is the reading order [prep_assets.py](../scripts/prep_assets.py) `cut` uses for the names.
Things that will fall from the tree are their own props: draw the tree separately and say "NO [fruit] in the crown".

## 4. Hero, two poses (image edit, opaque magenta, two takes)

> Game character sprite sheet, two poses of the same character side by side, full body, on a perfectly flat solid
> magenta (#FF00FF) background, no shadows on the ground, no text. Character: the [hero] from the reference
> screenshot, in exactly the same polished cartoon style: [details]. Camera: classic 2D side-scrolling platformer,
> pure side profile view facing right, no perspective. Left pose: standing ready to run, facing right, weight slightly
> forward, knees slightly bent. Right pose: the same character mid-air in a jump, facing right, knees tucked up, arms
> raised. Both figures the same size, each about 60% of the image height, generous empty space around each. No pink,
> no purple, no magenta anywhere on the character.

The magenta field is for keying; a character with pink or red parts (a scarf, a hat) needs the "no magenta" line and
care when keying. The left pose becomes the first frame of the run clip
([reframe_stills.py](../scripts/reframe_stills.py)).

## 5. Run cycle (image to video, first frame = the reframed left pose)

> 2D cartoon game sprite animation, like a treadmill: the [hero] immediately starts running in place and keeps
> running for the whole clip, a steady fast repeating run cycle: [how this body runs: knees high and arms pumping,
> or a four-legged gallop], both feet leave the ground between steps, body bobbing slightly, [tail, accessory]
> bouncing. [He] always faces right in a pure side profile view like a 2D side-scrolling platformer, the same angle as
> the first frame, never turning toward the camera. [He] stays centered and does not travel across the frame. Locked
> static camera, no zoom, flat solid magenta background that never changes, no ground, no ground shadow, same
> character design, colors and clean cartoon outlines as the first frame, no motion blur.

"Like a treadmill", "stays centered", "locked static camera" and "background that never changes" each closed a
failure. A five-second clip is enough: only one clean period (9 to 12 frames at 24 fps) is kept.

## A new look

Same ten roles, same order, a new concept frame. Keep the layer sizes, the hero's share of the frame and the
ground's walkable line close to the first look, so the measured numbers in `config.json` change little.
