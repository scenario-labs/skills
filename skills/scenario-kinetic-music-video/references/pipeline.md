## 1. Scaffold

```bash
bash <skill >/scripts/scaffold.sh /path/to/song.mp3 # run inside the new project folder
```

This creates `audio/master.*`, the `engine/` template, `tools/` (with the matte binary on macOS), fonts, npm deps (three, playwright) and a Python 3.11 `.venv`. On a machine that already has a project, you can symlink `.venv` and `node_modules` from it to save time.

## 2. Audio and lyrics

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/audio_analysis.py audio/master.mp3                              # stems + engine/data/audio.json (prints BPM and downbeats)
.venv/bin/python tools/lyrics_align.py transcribe                                      # plain pass, also kept as analysis/lyrics_raw_plain.json
.venv/bin/python tools/lyrics_align.py transcribe --prompt "<names, jargon, acronyms>" # hinted pass (lyrics_raw_hints.json); align reads the latest
# → hand-write analysis/lyrics.txt (sections + corrected lines; the user's lyrics win if supplied)
.venv/bin/python tools/lyrics_align.py align analysis/lyrics.txt --no-fix <ACRONYMS >[--chant <section >: <WORD >]
.venv/bin/python tools/plot_lyrics.py 1:12 20:30 ... # Read the PNGs; fix outliers by hand in lyrics.json
```

- **Verify the tempo.** Beat trackers and song-generation prompts can be off by a factor (a "130 BPM" track measured 98 with double-time drums). Check the median beat dt against the kick envelope, and write the measured grid into TREATMENT.md.
- Treat lines you couldn't make out as guesses, and list them for the user at the end.
- **A repeated shout** (`--chant <section>:<WORD>`): write that section's words into `lyrics.txt` as sung. The aligner places one WORD per vocal peak between the lines around the section, at most as many as you wrote; an empty section takes every peak up to the next line, or to the song's end.

## 3. Scenario: subject, style frames, assets

- **Workspace.** Get the team and project with `teams_list`. If there is more than one, ask the user. Pass `team_id` and `project_id` on every call. Log every asset and job id in `analysis/jobs.md` as you go, because revisions need them.
- **Upload references.** Use the multipart flow: `upload_asset(file_name, content_type, kind, file_size)` returns a presigned URL. `curl -fsS -X PUT -T file '<url>'` (no checksum headers), then `upload_asset_complete(upload_id)`. Inline base64 is only for files under 100 KB.
- **Subject sheet first.** A subject can be a character, mascot, creature, band avatar or product.
  - Turn the user's reference images into a model sheet (turnaround, expressions, detail callouts) before any footage. Pick an image model that takes reference images (`recommend` with `capability: "img2img"`, then `model_schema_get`): pass the references through the model's reference-image field and ask for a wide, high-quality output, two takes when the budget allows and one per subject otherwise; a cameo subject gets its own sheet (field names and size caps from `model_schema_get`).
  - The prompt covers identity details, the outfit or materials, the rendering style with explicit NOTs (not Pixar, not chibi), the layout, and lighting that matches the video's sets.
  - Look at it. Crop identity references from it (face, full-body 3/4) with ffmpeg and upload them.
  - For a real person, use only their own photos with their consent. Never generate other real people.
- **Style frames: one per shot.** Before any video, generate a still at the canvas ratio (`CANVAS`: 16:9, or 9:16 on a portrait project) for every planned shot in its section's look. Same model, with the sheet and an identity crop as references, the same ratio, high quality (fields from `model_schema_get`). Every prompt needs:
  - the look's art style, named explicitly ("drawn only with glowing gold light lines on pure black", "flat tangerine cyc", "B&W 35mm film")
  - composition that leaves **negative space for the type** ("framed on the right third, left two thirds empty"; on portrait, "face at about 40% of the frame height, empty space above it for type, nothing that must read in the bottom third"). On portrait, keep the face and the type space inside the safe band: platform UI covers roughly the top 14%, the bottom 35%, 6% on the left and 13% on the right (authoring-time values, the defaults of `E.SAFE`). The subject's body may run below it.
  - a set the compositor can use (black void with a hard rim light, a flat color cyc, or a white high-key set)
  - "No text, no letters, no logos" (all real type is done in code)
  - Contact-sheet all the frames and show the user before spending on video. A style frame is the cheapest paid step; price the video steps with `dry_run`, one run per distinct payload (clip length and resolution move the price), and total them. To quote the whole video before any spend, price the video payloads with an uploaded reference photo standing in for each frame: in the live test those quotes matched every video job's billed `cuCost`. Ask the user to approve the look and the total before launching; unattended, stop if no budget or no explicit team and project was given.
- **Props and 3D.** Image-to-3D (an untextured, low-face-count mesh is enough; read the options from the schema) gives a GLB for three.js (wireframe → solid reveals, a creature that peels off a page).
- Download with `asset_download` → `curl -L`. Always look at the results before going on.

## 4. Scenario: footage routes

Find current models with `recommend`, passing each lane's value as `capability` (`img2video`, `audio2video`; a reference-image, reference-audio dance is `img2video` with the reference features; lip-sync correction is `video2video`, with the job in the prompt) and read each schema with `model_schema_get`. Pass a clip length through the `duration` argument, never in the prompt: `recommend` read "under 10 s" there as a latency limit. Footage is generated at the canvas ratio: image-to-video follows a 9:16 first frame where the schema says the frame sets the shape, other routes take the ratio through the schema's aspect field, and a member that offers neither gets a new `recommend`, never a cropped 16:9 clip. The parameters below are concepts, not payloads: the schema wins. `dry_run` every distinct payload and total the quotes. Launch everything in parallel with `wait:false` (a top-level `model_run` argument, beside `parameters`), then `jobs_wait` with all job ids, re-called with `pending_job_ids` until none are pending. A wait timeout is not a failure: never relaunch a run, and never poll with `job_get`.

| shot                              | route                                                                                                                          | key params                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **any action from a style frame** | image-to-video                                                                                                                 | first frame, duration, resolution, the canvas ratio where the schema has an aspect field, native audio off                               |
| **dance locked to the song**      | reference-image and reference-audio video + a synthesized beat track                                                           | reference images (sheet, crop or frame), the beat track as reference audio, duration, the canvas ratio, native audio off; then beat-warp |
| **lip-sync** (preferred)          | audio-to-video from a style frame and a vocal slice                                                                            | first frame, the vocal slice as audio, resolution, the canvas ratio where the schema has one, an optional camera-motion preset           |
| **lip-sync** (alternative)        | reference-audio video with the vocal stem, then a lip-sync correction model (video and audio in, cut-off sync mode if offered) | measure with `lipsync_check.py`                                                                                                          |
| **a moment code does better**     | build it in JS instead (node networks, constellations, charts, UI, particles, any text)                                        | generated versions of these looked worse and were replaced                                                                               |

- **Prompt shape** (every good shot had these parts):
  1. what each `@image`/`@audio` input is for ("Animate this exact image, keep its exact art style of …")
  2. one dominant action, with timing cues in clip seconds if needed ("near the end she slowly closes her eyes")
  3. one camera move
  4. the set and light, held constant ("background stays pure black", "rim light stays constant")
  5. exclusions ("No text, no captions, no logos, no watermark, no other people. Silent footage.")
- **Synth beat track for dances:** `.venv/bin/python tools/synth_beat.py <slot> <dur> assets/audio_slices/<name>_beat.wav`. Upload it and say "@audio1 is a percussion timing guide: every hit lands exactly on the kicks and snares". The clip then belongs at song time `slot`.
- **Reference images keep a normal shape.** A full-body crop narrower than 0.4 (width over height) failed one member's reference check after `dry_run` had priced the payload without complaint. Pad tall crops toward the canvas ratio before uploading.
- **Vocal slices for lip-sync** come from the vocal stem as WAV (mp3 adds priming delay): `ffmpeg -i stems/htdemucs/master/vocals.wav -ss <slot> -t <dur> -ac 1 -ar 44100 -c:a pcm_s16le assets/audio_slices/<name>.wav`. The clip belongs at `slot`. Lip-sync prompts ask for "precise, expressive lip sync, strong mouth shapes on every syllable", with the mouth always visible and hands out of frame.
- **Never send the song itself** to a video model. Moderation rejects it, and `generateAudio:true` can reproduce the vocal and fail the job. Use beat tracks and vocal stems only.
- **Shot mix to plan:**
  - a hook close-up for frame 0
  - 2-3 lip-sync shots in different looks
  - 2-4 full-body dances or formations
  - a long-shot action (a sprint or leap)
  - a spin or signature move
  - a few "concept" shots that illustrate specific lyrics
  - a finale
  - Include full-body long shots as well as close-ups. About 17 frames, 17 videos and 6 lip-syncs came to about 6k CU at 720p; a 1080p portrait remake with 24 frames and 27 clips came to about 15k.
- **Revisions:** a shot that doesn't work gets regenerated in a different look or replaced by code. Don't patch it with effects. For a bad cut-out (fine detail such as fingers on a keyboard, or hair on white), regenerate the shot in a style that keys cleanly (pixel art, flat color), or show the full plate inside a window.

## 5. Footage prep: frames, mattes, tracking, checks

```bash
bash tools/prep_clip.sh                       # every assets/clips/*.mp4 → assets/video/<clip>/ frames + m_*.png mattes + track.json
bash tools/prep_clip.sh lip_a dance_b         # or only some clips
.venv/bin/python tools/fixmatte.py <clip>     # flat color-cyc clips: union a chroma key with the Vision matte (keeps floor shadows out)
.venv/bin/python tools/fixmatte.py <clip> --white   # white high-key clips (not when the subject wears white: a white hoodie reads as background and the matte gets holes)
.venv/bin/python tools/beatwarp.py <clip> <slot>                                     # dance clips: meta.warp time remap onto the song's accents
.venv/bin/python tools/dance_sync_check.py assets/clips/<clip>.mp4 <slot>             # motion-onset vs beat correlation
.venv/bin/python tools/lipsync_check.py assets/clips/<clip>.mp4 assets/audio_slices/<vocal>.wav out/ls_<clip>.png
ffmpeg -i assets/clips/<clip>.mp4 -vf "fps=2,scale=320:-1,tile=6x4" -frames:v 1 out/sheet_<clip>.jpg   # then Read it
```

- **Mattes:** `tools/matte` uses Apple Vision's foreground-instance mask. It is free and takes about 0.1 s per frame, writing 8-bit `m_#####.png` (white = subject).
  - Open a few mattes and check them over a bright color, especially hair, fingers and anything near a white background.
  - Matte sources, in order. Apple Vision first: free, fast and good on people. When `tools/matte` is missing (no macOS, or an unaccepted Xcode license blocks `swiftc`) or its matte fails on a clip (white subject on a white set, props, hair), use Scenario: `recommend` with `video2video` for video background removal, ask for a solid magenta background rather than transparency (a transparent request can come back in a container without alpha), `dry_run` it, run it on the clip's asset, `asset_download` the result, then `.venv/bin/python tools/matte_keyed.py <clip> <keyed.mp4> --force`. MediaPipe last: `.venv/bin/python tools/matte_fallback.py <clip> ...` is free but soft, keeps people and loses props and fine detail.
  - Rerun `fixmatte.py` on flat-cyc clips after replacing a matte, then `track.py`.
- **Pixel-art subjects:** soft mattes look dirty on pixel edges. Threshold to a hard binary mask on the pixel grid and add a 1-cell ink outline.
- **Tracking:** `track.py` writes MediaPipe pose (33 landmarks) plus the matte bbox, centroid, area and top point per frame. Pose fails on non-human subjects and on wide group shots, but the matte-derived fields still work.
- Write each clip's content, key moments (in clip time), slot and matte quality into TREATMENT.md's footage map. Agents work from it.

## 6. Engine and agents

Run `tools/track.py` after the mattes exist: it writes `box`, `c` and `top` from the matte, and a clip tracked before them has pose only.

- **Before launching agents:**
  - Write STYLE.md and TREATMENT.md (see SKILL.md), and AGENTS_BRIEF.md from `references/agent_brief_template.md`. Copy ENGINE_API.md into the project.
  - Fill in `engine/timeline.js` (`CANVAS`, sections on downbeats, `HUD`, `POST`) and set `PAL` in `core.js`.
  - Write a tiny `_smoke.js`: plate → type behind the subject → matte → tracked label. Render one still and a 5 s clip, then run `av_sync_check.py`.
- **Launch** one `general-purpose` agent per section in a single message (background). Each prompt names its file, time range, lyrics, must-have ideas and footage, and says to read the brief first. Log the agent ids in `analysis/agents.md`, so revisions can resume them.
- **Review** each report as it arrives: build a contact sheet of its best stills and Read it. Fix engine-level problems yourself and tell every agent what changed.

## 7. Assembly, grade and verification

```bash
node tools/render.mjs --fps 60 --scale 1 --workers 3 --crf 17 --out out/final/v1.mp4 [--variant b] [--to <end >]
.venv/bin/python tools/av_sync_check.py out/final/v1.mp4 0                                          # expect audio 0.0 ms; visual 0..+1 frame
ffmpeg -i out/final/v1.mp4 -vf "freezedetect=n=0.003:d=0.25" -map 0:v -f null - 2>&1 | grep freeze_ # frozen footage or graphics
ffmpeg -i out/final/v1.mp4 -vf "fps=2,scale=384:-1" -q:v 4 out/watch/f_%04d.jpg                     # then tile 8x5 per 20 s (`tools/sheet.py <out.jpg> <cols> <img>...`) and Read every sheet
```

- **Freezes:** check every hit from `freezedetect`. A held footage frame (a clip that ran out, or a slot clip shown before its slot) was rejected as "static". Intentional holds of pure graphics are fine if something still moves.
- Check each section boundary at −1/0/+1 frames.
- **Portrait safe band:** for each 20 s window, `node tools/still.mjs --range <a>:<a+20>:1 --scale 0.5 --safe --dir out/safe/<a> --sheet safe --cols 5`, then Read each sheet. Every word, logo and face sits inside the dashed band; full-bleed footage and graphics may run behind it.
- Do a global look pass: a still sheet across all sections, then tune `POST`, the palette and the HUD theme before the final render.

## 8. Delivery

```bash
# landscape canvas: the X-ready file (YouTube takes the master itself)
ffmpeg -i out/final/vN.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset slow -b:v 21M -maxrate 25M -bufsize 42M -pass 1 -an -f mp4 /dev/null
ffmpeg -i out/final/vN.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset slow -b:v 21M -maxrate 25M -bufsize 42M -pass 2 -pix_fmt yuv420p -profile:v high -c:a aac -b:a 192k -ar 44100 -movflags +faststart out/final/vN_x_1080p60.mp4
# portrait canvas: one vertical upload for TikTok, Reels and Shorts (the platforms re-encode, so keep quality high)
ffmpeg -i out/final/vN.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 17 -pix_fmt yuv420p -profile:v high -c:a aac -b:a 192k -ar 44100 -movflags +faststart out/final/vN_vertical_1080x1920.mp4
# teaser: END is the teaser length in seconds, FADE = END - 0.6
ffmpeg -i out/final/vN.mp4 -t "$END" -af "afade=t=out:st=$FADE:d=0.6" out/final/vN_teaser.mp4
```

- **Vertical length:** platform caps on vertical uploads change often (Shorts, Reels and TikTok each set their own); check the target's current limit before the final render, and cut the teaser when the song runs longer.
- **Two ratios:** the renders are `vN_16x9.mp4` and `vN_9x16.mp4` (§9). Run each encode on its own canvas's render and carry the suffix into every output (`vN_9x16_vertical_1080x1920.mp4`, `vN_9x16_teaser.mp4`), so nothing collides.
- **Name outputs distinctly.** macOS filenames are case-insensitive, so an encode named like its input with different case overwrites the input mid-encode.
- **Variants:** render each with `--variant`, and name the files by what differs (`_ending_b.mp4`).
- **Stills:** `node tools/still.mjs --t <times> --scale 1 --dir out/stills` gives lossless PNGs at the canvas size (1920×1080 or 1080×1920) straight from the engine.
- **Style sheet / making-of:** publish an artifact or doc with the palette, type, subject sheets, source-vs-final footage pairs, a frame index, the pipeline and the iteration count.

## 9. Two ratios from one project

Only when the user asks for both: one canvas is the default. Everything in code is shared, so the analysis, lyrics, STYLE, TREATMENT, scenes and HUD render on the second canvas at no generation cost. Footage is not.

- **Pick the primary canvas,** the platform that matters most, and set it as `CANVAS`. When the user names both without ranking them, ask; unattended, landscape. Style frames and footage are generated at its ratio, as in §3 and §4.
- **Per shot on the secondary canvas,** cheapest first:
  1. **Window it.** Play the primary clip whole inside the other frame (a band, a card, a split panel or a type window, per `motion_library.md` §5) and let graphics fill the rest. Free, and it reads as design.
  2. **Regenerate it** at the secondary ratio: a new style frame composed for that ratio (same references, same look), then the same footage route. It costs what the original cost, so `dry_run` it. Keep it for the shots that must fill the frame: the frame-0 hook, lip-sync close-ups and the finale.
- **Never cover-crop 16:9 to fill 9:16.** It keeps under a third of the width (608 of 1920 px on a 1080p clip, 405 of 1280 on 720p), upscaled about 1.8 to 2.7 times, and it usually cuts the subject.
- **Budget:** quote both canvases before launching: the primary footage plus the regenerated shots. Tell the user which shots are windowed on which canvas.
- **Scenes:** every plate takes `fit: E.plateFit(E, v)` (and the same options in `plateToScreen`), which fills the frame when the clip matches the canvas and windows it when it does not; `drawPlate`'s own default is `cover`, which would crop. A regenerated shot is a new clip with its own prep (§5), picked by canvas in the same scene (`E.loadVideo(E.ORIENT === 'portrait' ? 'hook_v' : 'hook')`). Give a section a second scene file only when its layout diverges (a wide poster slam), and tag the pair in `TIMELINE`: `canvas: 'landscape'` on one, `canvas: 'portrait'` on the other.
- **Render and verify each canvas:** `node tools/render.mjs --fps 60 --scale 1 --workers 3 --crf 17 --out out/final/vN_16x9.mp4`, then the same with `--canvas portrait --out out/final/vN_9x16.mp4` (swap them when portrait is the primary). Run §7's checks on each file, plus the safe-band sheets on the portrait one (`still.mjs --canvas portrait --safe` when the primary is landscape).
- **Deliver** one set per canvas, suffixed by ratio as in §8.
