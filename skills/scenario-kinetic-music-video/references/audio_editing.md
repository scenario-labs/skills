# Editing an approved soundtrack

Use this workflow when the director requests an audio change. Keep the original recording, current approved master, and candidates separate. Record the source asset or file hash, sample rate, channels, requested words, destination window, candidate source window, model parameters, selected take, and crossfade lengths in the project's edit notes.

## Choose the smallest useful edit

- **Pronunciation or one lyric:** audition a corrected performance, then replace only that phrase. Repaint supplies a new take within a window; it does not guarantee the same singer, melody or backing. The `scenario-ace-step` skill explains when a high-strength Cover candidate is worth trying for voice continuity, and the Repaint recipe for changing sung words. Do not regenerate the whole soundtrack into the final cut merely to repair one line.
- **Different energy, genre or singer:** offer distinct short auditions before recutting the picture. A new recording needs a new timing analysis even if its requested BPM and lyrics match.
- **Trim, remove, repeat or rearrange existing material:** use deterministic editing. Prefer musical phrase boundaries and verify both joins; a crossfade alone does not fix a cut across a sung syllable or conflicting beats.

For generation, discover the named family with `search`, inspect the selected member with `model_schema_get`, and upload the source or reuse its asset id. Use the current schema and sibling skill for model-specific fields, not guessed parameters. Price each distinct payload with `model_run(dry_run=true)` inside the authorized budget, launch with `wait=false`, and use `jobs_wait` again on pending jobs. A timeout is not a reason to regenerate. Display candidates with `asset_display`; download with `asset_download` without an audio conversion `format`.

## Audition before replacing

Locate the phrase with the supplied lyrics, waveform and transcription together. Give the model enough context around consonants and breaths; record the replacement interval separately from that context. A returned file may be a full song or a section: inspect its duration and align the intended span in both recordings instead of assuming its origin is zero or that its timestamps match the master.

Present short original/candidate previews with identical surrounding context and clear take labels. For acronyms, a phonetic spelling can help the model sing separate letters; retain normal spelling in displayed lyrics. Compare pronunciation, singer identity, pitch, rhythm, accompaniment, loudness and transitions. Neither a transcript nor waveform similarity proves that it sounds right. If listening is unavailable, state that limitation and let the director select from previews. An existing selection authorizes applying that take without another confirmation. If no candidate works, keep the master and revise the attempt only within the authorized retry scope and budget. Unattended, with no prior take selection or explicit delegation to choose, stop after saving the labeled previews and list the pending choice; do not apply a take or spend on another batch to avoid waiting.

## Apply the selected span

Use the fixed first-party audio trimmer `model_scenario-audio-cut` when extracting a candidate on Scenario; it is the platform's deterministic audio trimmer. Inspect its schema first. As documented in `scenario-ace-step`, downloaded spans can be spliced locally because MCP has no audio-join tool; do not invent a join API or substitute another generative run.

Decode the original once to a lossless working master. Match the candidate's sample rate and channel layout, align it to the destination, and preserve the original sample count for an in-place correction. Do not stretch the whole song to fit a patch. Start with short crossfades, for example 10-30 ms, adjust by audition, and keep every blended sample inside the declared edit window. Match gain locally rather than normalizing the whole master. Compare decoded samples outside the window for exact equality before lossy export. A deliberately length-changing edit instead needs an explicit timeline mapping and new downstream timings.

## Reconnect and verify

Save a uniquely named master and point `engine/data/audio.json.master` at it. Refresh affected word alignments, vocal stems and envelopes; if timing or structure changed, rerun analysis and update cuts, beat accents and lip-sync footage. Use a new basename for analysis: `audio_analysis.py` reuses stems already present under that name. Transcription, plots and vocal slices must use the stem for the master named in `engine/data/audio.json`, resolved by `audio_paths.py`; a missing stem is an error, never a reason to use an older take. Rerun transcription before alignment and regenerate affected vocal slices and lip-sync shots.

Check sample count, clipping, boundary clicks, gaps and local loudness, and audition each join in context. Render a preview with the actual captions and cuts, then run `av_sync_check.py` against the approved master. Exact sample preservation is a lossless-master claim, not a claim about an AAC/MP3 export. For picture-only revisions, stream-copy the approved encoded audio when container compatibility and duration allow; otherwise encode from the approved master once and check timing. Report what was measured, what was auditioned, and any remaining uncertainty separately.
