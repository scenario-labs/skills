# Scenario ChatGPT Pet: Update

## Overview

An existing pet is its sprite sheet: a PNG or WebP the user downloaded from ChatGPT, a Codex pet folder (`pet.json` plus the sheet it names), or a Scenario asset id of a sheet made earlier. That file is the pet's identity here; there is no pet record to look up. The update never overwrites it: the result is a new package next to the run, with the same id and name unless the user changes them.

This skill runs the scripts and follows the sheet contract of `scenario-chatgpt-pet-create`, which must be installed; run each script by its path in that skill's `scripts/` folder, from the user's working folder, and read the contract before generating a row or writing direction verdicts: [pet_frames.py](../scenario-chatgpt-pet-create/scripts/pet_frames.py), [pet_prepare.py](../scenario-chatgpt-pet-create/scripts/pet_prepare.py), [pet_build.py](../scenario-chatgpt-pet-create/scripts/pet_build.py), [pet_check.py](../scenario-chatgpt-pet-create/scripts/pet_check.py), [pet_preview.py](../scenario-chatgpt-pet-create/scripts/pet_preview.py), [pet_package.py](../scenario-chatgpt-pet-create/scripts/pet_package.py), and [the contract](../scenario-chatgpt-pet-create/references/sheet-contract.md). Generation follows that skill's loop and model order (`model_openai-gpt-image-2-5-sunburst`, then `model_google-gemini-nano-banana-2-1`, then `recommend` only when both are blocked); connection and scope: the `scenario` skill. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

## Quick reference

Read the sheet first, then pick the smallest change that does the job:

| The user wants                                 | Do                                                                                                  | Generations   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| To see or check it                             | `pet_check.py`, `pet_preview.py contact` and `gif`                                                  | 0             |
| A rename or new description                    | `init`, `pet_check.py <sheet> --run RUN`, then `pet_package.py make RUN --sheet <sheet> --name ...` | 0             |
| Leftover pixels, color under transparency      | `pet_build.py RUN --clean`                                                                          | 0             |
| A row whose frames pop up and down or sideways | `pet_build.py RUN --reregister <row>`: re-places the existing frames on one ground line and anchor  | 0             |
| One or a few states redone                     | `init --only <rows>`, generate those rows, `pet_build.py RUN`: every other row stays byte for byte  | one per row   |
| Look directions on a v1 sheet                  | `init --version 2 --only look`: cardinals, then rows 9 and 10                                       | 3             |
| A new look (outfit, color, accessory)          | `init --change "<the change>"`: edit the identity, approve it, regenerate every row                 | 1 + every row |

`split` refuses anything that is not 1536x1872 or 1536x2288: other art is a new pet, made with `scenario-chatgpt-pet-create` using that art as a reference.

## Worked example: Pepper's stiff run, then a red scarf for next season

1. **Get the sheet.** The user points at `~/.codex/pets/pepper/`: read `pet.json` (`id`, `displayName`, `description`, `spritesheetPath`) and copy the sheet into a work folder. From an asset id: `asset_download` with `format: "png"`, then `curl -L`.
2. **Read it.** `pet_frames.py split pepper.png --out work/split` prints the version, a background key that contrasts with the pet, and `pixel_grid` (set when the sheet is pixel art with on/off alpha; the update then keeps that grid and palette). `pet_check.py pepper.png --json-out work/before.json` measures it: height per row against idle, jump lift, look-row drift. `pet_preview.py contact` and `pet_preview.py gif` show the current pet. Ask what should change if the request is vague, naming what the check found.
3. **Redo the run.** `pet_prepare.py init --name Pepper --id pepper --description "<from pet.json>" --from-split work/split --only running-right,running-left --out work/run` (every row of the table starts with an `init --from-split` like this; `--only` names the rows to generate). The `match` style keeps the sheet's look; each job's `references` are `references/base.png` (the idle frame, enlarged on the key) and `references/rows/<row>.png` (the current row). Each job maps onto one `model_run`: its `references` uploaded with `upload_asset` and passed as `referenceImages` (an array), its `prompt` verbatim, its `sizes` for the model, `background: "opaque"` on Sunburst, priced with `dry_run` first; download the result to the job's `output`. When the old row's motion is what is wrong (a jump that never lifts, a run that does not alternate), leave `references/rows/<row>.png` out, since the model copies what it is shown, and say what changes with `pet_prepare.py note work/run --jobs <row> --text "..."`. Then `pet_frames.py extract work/run --job running-right`, read the report and preview, and mirror it with `--mirror-left` or generate `running-left` the same way.
4. **Rebuild.** `pet_build.py work/run --mirror-left`. With the original sheet as the base (recorded by `init`), only the rebuilt rows change, scaled to the existing idle row's height, ground line and anchor; the edge cleanup touches only them. `pet_check.py work/run/final/spritesheet.webp --run work/run` must print `ok: true`; it warns that the look rows were not reviewed, which is expected when they were kept as they were.
5. **Show and package.** `pet_preview.py gif work/run/final/spritesheet.webp --out-dir work/run/previews`, show `pet.gif`, then `pet_package.py make work/run --id pepper`. Ask before `pet_package.py install work/run --force`, which backs up the installed Pepper into the run before replacing it.
6. **The scarf, later.** A new look changes every frame, so it is a new generation grounded in the old pet: `init --name Pepper --id pepper --description "<from pet.json>" --from-split work/split --change "add a red knitted scarf" --out work/scarf` adds an edit job on the identity image. Approve the edited base, then run every row as `scenario-chatgpt-pet-create` does from its rows step (look rows included for a v2 sheet, with fresh direction verdicts). The old sheet still sets the pet's size, so the new pet does not grow or shrink.

For a v1 to v2 upgrade (`init --version 2 --only look`), run `look-cardinals`, `look-9` and `look-10` as the create skill describes and write the direction verdicts; the build keeps rows 0-8 and adds the two look rows.

## Common mistakes

- Overwriting the user's file or installed pet: work on a copy, and replace an installed Codex pet only after a yes, with `--force` (which backs it up).
- Regenerating the whole pet for one bad row: redo that row; the build copies the others byte for byte.
- Sending the whole sheet to an image model as the reference: it reads as a grid of small frames and the model copies the grid. Use `references/base.png` and the row strip `split` made.
- Regenerating to fix what the build can fix: leftover pixels, color under transparency and a row that drifts are `--clean` and `--reregister`, at no cost.
- Rebuilding without the original sheet: a new row is then sized from nothing; `init --from-split` records the sheet so the build keeps the pet's size.
- Changing the pet's id on a rename: Codex finds the pet by its folder, so keep the id and change `displayName`.
- Handing a v2 result to someone uploading on ChatGPT web: give them `package/spritesheet-v1.png`.
